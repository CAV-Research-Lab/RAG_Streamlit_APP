 Abstract: This paper focuses on comparative results of two different controllers applied to 
kinematic bicycle model with rear wheel contact point to the ground as the reference point. 
The wide range of representation of different types of robots and vehicles of kinematic bicycle 
model is  the main reason for this model selection. This paper has three main sections. The first 
section of the paper is mathematical modeling of the model. The second section is describing 
the utilized control techniques. The last section shares results of the si mulations. The 
simulations have been carried out with pure feedback signals in absence of noise. The 
compared two controllers are an (Linear Quadratic Regulator)LQR controller and a Lyapunov 
based controller. The objective in the simulations is to track an d complete a given constant 
radius trajectory. Last section includes comparison of results by analyzing statistical values of 
a defined error signal.

1. Introduction  
 
Nowadays, the achievements in mobile robotics a llow  
advanced applications in real life. One of the popular 
tasks for autonomous and mobile robots is trajectory 
tracking. This task requires mathematical model of the 
mobile robot and a proper control approach to 
minimize the total deviation from a desired tr ajectory.   
In this research, the main aspect is to investigate the 
control performances of two different controllers which 
have been designed for a kinematic bicycle type 
wheeled mobile robot (WMR). The rear tire contact 
point assumed as a reference to acc omplish trajectory 
tracking task. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and 
Lyapunov based controllers are the applied control

approaches in this paper. MATLAB/Simulink 
environment has been used to simulate the trajectory 
tracking performances of the WMR.  
Rob otic motion, kinematic models and well -known 
control techniques are presented in many references. 
While [1 -3], [6] and [16] are covering most of these 
topics, other references such as [5] is concentrated on 
nonlinear control techniques and [4] is scoping 
Lyapunov stability and regulation problem.  
 
We can see that, using a linear controller is a practical 
approach to the problem as stated in [7]. This paper 
uses a differential drive type robot. Then subjects it to a 
coordinate transformation by using referen ce frames 
and input transformation. PI tuning with LQR is realized 
in 3 -dimensional state space system. In [8] a dynamic 
model of bicycle type robot is used together with its 
kinematic model. By this manner, a Lyapunov function 
is used for control. Stabili ty through Barbalat condition 
is studied.  
 
The kinematic model and linearization through input 
transformation is validated and a control scheme 
shown in [9]. This paper also uses a differential drive 
robot in 3 -dimensional error system linearized around 
origin. Linear feedback control is proposed with pole 
placement approach to regulate the  desired  
polynom ials. 
 
In [10] a 3 -dimensional state space system is 
considered under Lyapunov conditions. Dynamic model 
is utilized for the related study. [11] follows a  similar 
approach for a welding application combined with a 
wheeled mobile robot control.  
 
In [12] a differential drive model is the subject of 
feedback linearizing control to accomplish “Follow the 
Carrot” algorithm by replacing system nonlinearities 
with  desired dynamics. Position and orientation error 
form the error system. [17] and [18] are detailed and 
explanatory sources for optimal control theory.  
 
An inclusive reference for path tracking methods of 
autonomously steering vehicles is [13] . Dynamic and  
kinematic models are shown together with geometric 
tracking algorithms such as Pure Pursuit and Stanley 
Control. Kinematic and optimal control including LQR 
form are also investigated deeply.  
 
[14] considers center of wheelbase as the reference 
point of t he kinematic model. Therefore, another 3 -
dimensional approach is made by LQR -LMI tuning for a 
Lyapunov based controller.  
 
[15] Both forward and backward motions are 
considered for tractor trailer wheeled robot. Lyapunov   
based approach is stated for diffe rent types of 
trajectories. Slip condition is also considered.  
 
Instead of taking statically balanced models [19] takes 
an e -scooter model and investigates a higher 
dimensional state space system. This new system also 
takes self -stabilization as an additio nal task other than 
motion control.  
 
[20] takes even larger state space system with 12 
degrees of freedom. Tracking problem simulations are 
done for PD and H ∞ controllers then tested for PD 
controller.  
 
A time -varying LQR control is applied in [22] for 
tracking task. This paper uses a 4 -dimensional state 
space system as in our study.  
 
Contributions to WMR studies in “Automatic Control 
and Robotics Laboratory” of Dokuz Eylül University 
focus on linear and non -linear controller design, 
navigation, sensor f usion and implementations on 
experimental models. [23] realizes a path following task 
for autonomous vehicles by GPS measurement. [24] 
considers relative positioning of a robot together with 
trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance task. 
Sensory measurem ent and indoor mapping by a LIDAR 
are researched deeply in order to ensure autonomous 
navigation in [25]. Alongside traditional approaches, a 
neural network -based control approach is applied to a 
non-holonomic model using multiple sensors in [26].  
 
As another perspective, [27] takes the standard form of 
a PI controller and combine it with a nonlinear gain and 
control a second order system. Stability analysis is done 
for different criteria. Then all these considerations are 
subjected to a higher order  system which is the active 
suspension system. Reference tracking performances 
are evaluated for different system parameter settings. 
On the other hand [2 8] suggests a hybrid control 
approach by including a neural network to the tuning 
part. Then tracking performances are evaluated and 
compared for regular PD, Anfis and a hybrid controller 
constructed by both.  
 
1.1. Problem Definition  
 
Our work, unlike many applications, takes a four -
dimensional state space for kinematic bicycle model. 
Considered model uses  reference as rear wheel center. 
Reference inputs are longitudinal velocity and rate of 
change in steering angle. This consideration allows us 
to model many of the real -life robots and vehicles.  
Therefore, this paper can be considered as a case study 
for a  wide range autonomous wheeled mobile robots 
and a large class of vehicle family. Cars, busses,

motorcycles, scooters can be given as examples of this 
model.  
 
Moreover, the problem of tracking for this type of model 
is taken as the studied topic  to test the tracking 
controller performances . As stated above, the model is 
a representative of frequently encountered vehicle 
families and therefore tracking control for these types 
of vehicles becomes vital for the futuristic autonomous 
driving scenarios. This paper searches the less 
deviating tracking control for that matter.  
 
2.  Mathematical Modeling   
 
The rear wheel reference kinematic bicycle model is a 
very common model for a family of wheeled mobile 
robots. Equation 1 show the states for t his type of model. 
First two states x and y are taken as planar position 
information. Next states are orientation angle of the 
robot/vehicle and steering angle. They are shown with 
θ and φ respectively.  As a result,  a 4-dimensional  state 
vector is created.  
 
𝑝=(𝑥
𝑦
𝜃
𝜑) (1) 
 
The main principle is to apply a non -holonomic 
constraint for two wheels. The wheels are assumed not 
sliding sideways and motion is obtained only by rolling. 
This assumption results two constraints for two wheels.  
 
In Figure 1, coordinates of the robot can be seen as a 
vector of rear wheel cartesian coordinates, front wheel 
cartesian coordinates, orientation angle of whole body 
and steering angle. This is a redundant representation 
of this robot. Because with a const ant wheelbase “L” it 
is possible to rewrite one wheel’s coordinates by using 
the other one as in Equation 2 and 3. 
 
𝑥𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡=𝑥𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟+𝐿cos(𝜃) (2) 
𝑦𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡=𝑦𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟+𝐿sin(𝜃) (3) 
 
As can be seen in Equation 4 and 5, by derivation of 
these equations with respect to time, evolutions of 
states in time are obtained.  
 
𝑥̇𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡=𝑥̇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟−𝜃̇𝐿sin(𝜃) (4) 
𝑦̇𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡=𝑦̇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟+𝜃̇𝐿cos(𝜃) (5) 
  
Figure 1. Kinematic Rear Wheel Reference Bicycle 
Model  
 
 
If this new representation is used for writing the wheel 
constraints equation, the input vector fields can be 
obtained by Equation 6 and 7. 
 
𝑥̇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟sin(𝜃)−𝑦̇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟cos(𝜃)=0  (6) 
𝑥̇𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡sin(𝜃+𝜑)−𝑦̇𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑡cos(𝜃+𝜑)=0 (7) 
 
It is possible to rewrite this in matrix form. Integrability 
of the input vector fields will be guaranteed by this way. 
For simplicity of notation, rear subindices are dropped. 
Hence, coordinates are changed to a vector containing 
only one pair of cartesia n coordinates of rear wheel and 
two angular coordinates with orientation angle of the 
body and steering angle. Matrix form of the constraints 
on the wheels can be seen in Equation 8. 
 
[sin(𝜃)−cos(𝜃)0              0
sin(𝜃+𝜑)−cos(𝜃+𝜑)−𝐿cos(𝜑)0](𝑥̇
𝑦̇
𝜃̇
𝜑̇)=0  (8) 
 
The vector fields which satisfy these constraints are 
found and can be used for determination of input vector 
fields. Non -holonomy condition is satisfied for this 
model by a null space solution . 
 
Obtained vectors can be seen below in mathematically 
defined rear wheel kinematic bicycle model. By this 
knowledge it is possible to write the rear wheel 
reference kinematic bicycle model in state space form 
as in Equation 9.

Inputs are chosen to be linear velocity of body and 
angular velocity ( 10) as rate of change of steering angle 
(11) and can be written as:  
 
𝑣=√𝑥̇2+𝑦̇2 (10) 
𝑤=𝜑̇ (11) 
 
However, the resulting model is highly nonlinear and a 
direct linearization by derivation gives a set of 
equations which do not represent the robot motion. 
Therefore, a feedback linearization through coordinate 
transformation is done. Then control approaches are 
applied for this new system repr esentation. To get this 
new system, a reference state vector must be defined as 
in Equation 1 2. Ref subindices  represent reference.

By the measured states, the error vector is obtained and 
represented in a rotated coordinate system attached to 
the rear wheel of the kinematic bicycle type model. Full 
state measurement is assumed to be available. Error 
system can be defined as in Equation 1 3.

The transformation matrix in Equation 1 3 has the form 
of a planar rotation by the orientation angle of the 
model. This rotation is applied to x and y coordinates of 
model. However, angular states are expressed in their 
natural form. Followed procedure is allowing a 
definition of an error system which is described on 
longitudinal and lateral dynamics of the model. By 
rewriting the reference states like the model’s 
kinematic equations, the error system is rewritten 
clearly. Equations 1 4, 15, 16 and 1 7 show time 
derivatives  of the reference states.

Thanks to the differential flatness and constant 
parameters of the model, it is possible to obtain these 
reference states of the system. However, an additional 
calculation is necessary to express the curvature of 
desired trajectory. By this way it is possi ble to represent  
  
reference steering angle change rate and therefore rate 
of change of steering angle.  
 
Reference orientation of the trajectory is calculated in 
Equation 1 8. 
 
𝜃𝑟𝑒𝑓=tan−1(𝑦̇𝑟𝑒𝑓
𝑥̇𝑟𝑒𝑓) (18) 
 
Reference linear velocity of the trajectory is calculated 
in Equation 1 8. 
 
𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑓=√𝑥̇𝑟𝑒𝑓2+𝑦̇𝑟𝑒𝑓2 (19) 
 
Reference curvature and instantaneous center of 
rotation of the trajectory are calculated in Equation 20 
and 2 1.

Reference steering angle and its rate of change can be 
directly found by derivation of Equation 2 2. 
 
𝜑𝑟𝑒𝑓=tan−1(𝐿
𝑅𝑟𝑒𝑓) (22) 
 
Where, R ref is the distance between instantaneous 
center of rotation and rear wheel. L is the wheelbase of 
the robot. By this way, the rotated error equations are 
derived for cartesian coordinates. Then, reference 
expressions are used. Note that angular states are ke pt 
the same for error system generation.  
 
Evolution of error states with respect to time can be 
seen in Equation 2 3, 24, 25 and 2 6. This procedure is 
done by calculating Equation 13 with the terms 
calculated in Equations 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 
22.

This form still has a highly nonlinear relation. Small 
angle assumption is made and artificial inputs are 
introduced by redefining  original inputs . Redefined 
inputs are given in Equation 2 7, 28 and 2 9.

To avoid dynamic effects which can occur on tires and 
therefore on lateral motion, motion of the model  has 
been investigated using relatively smaller velocities. In 
this work a constant radius circul ar path is considered 
and details are presented in next sections.  
 
3. Control Methods  
 
In this study two control approaches are applied and 
simulation results are compared. These are Linear 
Quadratic Regulator and a Lyapunov based controller.  
 
3.1. Linear Quadratic Regulator ( LQR)  
 
In LQR design, linear quadratic cost function is used and 
shown in Equation 3 1. 
 
𝐽=∫(𝑥𝑇𝑄𝑥+𝑢𝑇𝑅𝑢)𝑑𝑡 (31) 
 
Where Q and R matrices are diagonal weights matrices 
for the states and inputs. In this case, states corres pond 
to errors and inputs are the artificial ones  shown in 
Equations 27, 28 and 29.  The feedback is obtained in a 
static manner. Thus, standard form can be rewritten as 
in Equation 3 2. 
 
𝐽=∫(𝑒𝑇𝑄𝑒+𝑢𝑇𝑅𝑢)𝑑𝑡 (32) 
 
In this research, the inputs are not penalized but states 
are weighted differently. State and input weights are 
expressed in Equation 3 3 and 3 4. The selection of 
weights are done by inspecting the Equations 27, 28, 29 
and 30. Since e 3 and e 4 represent the  error on  angular 
states in the or iginal system and the rotation is done by 
the orientation angle itself, more weights are given to 
those states. Another supporting observation can be 
pointed out  by the fact that e 1 and e 2 are highly 
dependent on both angular error states. Input 
weighting is not done and all virtual inputs are taken 
with the same weights. Therefore, Equations 32 and 33 
would be a viable selection for weights matrices.

Free system has two eigenvalues at origin and two 
complex eigenvalues at 0±0.6283i. LQR strategy places 
the eigenvalues to -31.6228, -31.6212, -2.9531, -0.7670. 
Corresponding gain matrix can be seen in Equation 3 5.

3.2. Lyapunov Based Controller  
 
Lyapunov functions are widely used in many fields of 
nonlinear control application. This paper follows a 
control approach with a storage function which is semi -
positive definite for any time while its derivative is 
negative semi -definite for any time insta nt. At the origin 
the storage function is equal to zero. Considered storage 
function is constructed by quadratic terms and a 
trigonometric term. Main reason behind this selection 
of structure is to stress out the property of boundaries 
of each function typ e. While quadratic functions have a 
lower bound at zero, trigonometric functions are 
defined in the range of ±1. Storage function and its 
derivative can be found in Equation 3 6 and 3 7. 
 
𝑉=1
2(𝑒12+𝑒22+𝑒42)+1−𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑒3)
𝑘2 (36) 
𝑉̇=𝑒1𝑒̇1+𝑒2𝑒̇2+𝑒4𝑒̇4+𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑒3)
𝑘2𝑒̇3 (37) 
 
For this approach, error system can be rewritten by 
releasing the small angle approximation and keeping 
the input transformation the same. A non -linear system 
is defined in Equation 3 8, 39, 40 and 4 1. 
 
𝑒̇1=𝑢1+(𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝜑𝑑)
𝑙−𝑢2)𝑒2 (38) 
𝑒̇2=𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑒3)−(𝑣𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝜑𝑑)
𝑙−𝑢2)𝑒1 (39) 
𝑒̇3=𝑢2 (40) 
𝑒̇4=𝑢3 (41) 
 
Finally, the Lyapunov criteria are checked and the 
controller performance is simulated. In order to have a 
negative semi -definite derivativ e for storage function, 
following feedback terms in Equation 4 2, 43 and 4 4 are 
used.

After adding the error system and feedback terms  
together , the resultant derivative function became 
negative semi -definite for all values of states. This 
operation is shown in Equation 4 5 and its simplified 
version in 4 6.

Controller gains are selected as follows in Equation 4 7, 
48 and 4 9. 
 
𝑘1=40 (47) 
𝑘2=40 (48) 
𝑘3=50 (49) 
 
Note that any positive value of Lyapunov gains will 
result a satisfactory result for Lyapunov Stability 
Theorem.  Controller gains are selected by trial and 
error. Starting from a small positive value and slowly 
increasing each value resulted these gains. Greater 
values would result more aggressive results.  
 
 
 4. Simulation Results and Discussion  
 
MATLAB /Simulink  environment is utilized to simulate 
the trajectory and the motion of the WMR. The selected 
task is to follow a circular reference trajectory with a 
diameter of 10 meters in 10 seconds. Therefore, the 
reference linear and angular speed inputs are co nstant 
π m/s and 0.2π rad/s. Necessary references can be 
obtained directly. These references are expressed in 
Equation 50 and 5 1.

The single important parameter of bicycle is its 
wheelbase of 1.5 meters. This parameter selected by 
considering an average bicycle/scooter. Steering angle 
is saturated in ±1.07 radians.  
 
Initial conditions are picked the same for both cases as 
shown in Equation 5 2. Which is the starting point on the 
trajectory. The goal is to follow the exact trajectory.

Figure 3. Lyapunov Control Scheme  
 
Figure 2 shows the Simulink scheme of kinematic 
bicycle model controlled via LQR technique.  A similar 
block scheme is created for Lyapunov based control 
technique in Simulink environment and can be seen in 
Figure 3.   
Simulations are  done for 10 seconds with fixed step of 
0.001 seconds. Solver selection is ODE4(Runge -Kutta).  
Results are plotted together with the reference 
trajectory and can be seen in Figure 4.

From first inspection of Figure 4 it is hard to evaluate 
performance of both control approaches. Therefore, a 
deviation metric is defined and considered as 
performance indicator. This deviation metric is 
measuring distance between reference trajectory poin t 
and kinematic bicycle model’s rear wheel contact point 
to the ground and the performances of both controllers 
can be seen in Table 1. Deviation metric is expressed in 
Equation 5 3. 
 
𝑑=√(𝑥𝑟−𝑥)2+(𝑦𝑟−𝑦)2 (53) 
 
For evaluation of performance, deviation from 
trajectory on each time step is collected. Then, 
cumulative deviation from reference trajectory is 
calculated together with mean and variance on x and y 
axes. These values are shared to the reader in previous 
table. Evolution of deviations i n both axes for each 
control strategy can be seen in Figure 5.  
 
Table 1 and Figure 5 give the meaningful performance 
differences. Importance of every single indicator can be clarified. First indicator is the cumulative deviation. 
Since Equation 5 3 collects  the deviation value from 
reference trajectory for every time step, summed 
deviation is the most important indicator of the 
tracking performance. As this indicator goes to zero, 
performance is to be said get better. However, this 
indicator is not the singl e performance indicator 
because of time dependency of this deviation. As shown 
in Figure 5, the deviation from reference trajectory 
changes over time along both axes of the cartesian 
coordinate system. Minimized variation around zero 
deviation from referen ce trajectory is the best 
expression of the performance analysis. Therefore, 
minimum deviation from reference trajectory can be 
defined statistically.  
 
Both control techniques have very small mean 
deviations on both cartesian coordi nate axes. However, 
variances around this mean value separates two 
scenarios. In Figure 5 this consideration becomes more 
visible. While oscillations around zero are similar in 
terms of frequency, their amplitude show how 
cumulative error gets greater for LQR control approach.

the performance difference of a linear and a nonlinear 
controller approach on kinematic bicycle model. Both 
techniques are well known and widely used approaches. 
Lyapunov based controller action needs an additional 
term other than the states of the system which is the 
reference speed input. However, LQR only utilizes a 
predefined ga in matrix for a simpler feedback action. 
This situation gives another conclusion for the 
compared control approaches. Since Lyapunov based 
control action utilizes reference linear velocity in its 
feedback calculation, it is possible to define a time - 
varyi ng positive term and apply this controller for time 
dependent cases. To be more clear, this controller 
would be able to track varying radius trajectories. On 
the other hand, LQR control strategy would not be able 
to calculate such a feedback matrix because  of variable 
system matrix entities.  
 
4. Conclusion  
 
In this research two different types of control strategies 
are derived and applied to kinematic bicycle model. 
Control strategies rely on Linear Quadratic Regulator 
and Lyapunov Stability Theorem. For both control 
strategies, stability is searched and guar anteed by 
designed feedback actions. Reference trajectory was a 
circle with radius of 5 meters, which had to be 
completed in 10 seconds. Reference speed inputs were 
decided to be constants. Kinematic bicycle model was 
able to follow the reference trajector y with small 
deviations for suggested control settings. Performance 
comparison is made and seen that Lyapunov based 
control strategy performed a better tracking result. 
Future work can be done for obstacle avoidance and 
globally asymptotically controllers.  As a future work, 
for testing the performance of the developed controller 
in real environment, an experimental study on a 
wheeled robot model is planned. Noise cancellation , 
sensor measurement and data filtering would be 
another challenging task for reali zation.  
 
It is evident that Lyapunov based control strategy 
performed better than LQR approach. Both techniques 
have at least a mean deviation of order  10-2 from 
reference trajectory. Hence, both strategies are 
resulting reliably good performance. Moreover, LQR 
strategy should have a better performance under noisy 
measurement  application  or uncertainties  due to its 
lower dependency on variables. Future studie s can be 
constructed under this idea.  
 
However, both techniques need to be applied around 
reference trajectory and a preliminary system matrix 
analysis and design is necessary. Moreover, an obstacle 
avoidance strategy and a global planner must be added before deploying such controller. By this way it would 
be possible to get a global control approach.
