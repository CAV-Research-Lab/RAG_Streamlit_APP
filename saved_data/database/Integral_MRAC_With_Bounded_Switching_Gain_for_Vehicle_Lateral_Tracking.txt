Abstract — In this article, an enhanced model reference adap-
tive control (EMRAC) algorithm is used to design a genericlateral-tracking controller for a vehicle. This EMRAC is differentfrom the EMRAC in the literature as it adopts a σ-modiﬁcation
approach to bind the adaptive gain of the switching action.Moreover, an extended Lyapunov theory for discontinuous sys-tems is used to analytically prove the ultimate boundedness ofthe closed-loop control system when the adaptive gain of theswitching action is bounded with a σ-modiﬁcation strategy. The
control algorithm is applied to a vehicle path-tracking problemand its tracking performance is investigated under conditionsof: 1) external disturbances such as crosswind; 2) road surfacechanges; 3) modeling errors; and 4) parameter missmatches in aco-simulation environment based on IPG Carmaker/MATLAB.The simulation studies show that the controller is effectiveat tracking a given reference path for performing differentautonomous highway driving maneuvers while ensuring theboundedness of all closed-loop signals even when the system issubjected to the conditions mentioned above.

I. I NTRODUCTION
THE mainstreaming of autonomous vehicles is happening
at an increasingly rapid pace in the current decade. The
recent push toward autonomous driving has resulted in an
ever-increased focus of researchers to propose improvements
and devise enhancements for the th ree architectural layers that
are typically present in every self-driving platform [1].
1)Scanning and Perception: Responsible for gathering
information about the driving conditions in the neigh-
borhood of the autonomous vehicle.
2)Planning: Utilize input from the perception layer to
compute a safe and feasible driving trajectory for thevehicle.

and brake input to make the autonomous vehicle follow
the reference trajectory a s closely as possible while
ensuring the safety and comfort of the occupants.
While the ﬁrst two layers are relative newcomers to the ﬁeld
of automotive engineering, the control layer, which includes
lateral/path-tracking control systems, has been a topic of
intense research over the past few decades and comprehensive
reviews on this topic are available in [2] and [3]. These reviewsdemonstrate that control of lateral dynamics of a vehicle
poses a formidable challenge for control engineering due to
a combination of reasons such as: 1) signiﬁcant dependenceof lateral dynamics on the longitudinal velocity of a vehicle;
2) nonlinear tire dynamics; 3) dif ﬁculties in estimation of
system parameters such as road surface coefﬁcient, vehicle
mass distribution; and 4) nonlinearities of road/path curvature.
The typical control techniques for path-tracking in technical
literature are aimed at reducing the lateral position error of the
vehicle with respect to the path while ensuring lateral and yaw
stability. Researchers have proposed a variety of control tech-niques to achieve desirable pat h-tracking performance for an
autonomous vehicle [1]–[3]. There are control strategies based
on geometric constraints such as: 1) follow the carrot [2];
2) Stanley controller [4]; and 3) pure pursuit [2] which have
demonstrated their effectivenes s in various experimental tests
[3], [5]–[7]. Although these control techniques are relatively
easy to implement on real-time hardware and provide desired
tracking performance around the nominal operational condi-tion, their performance rapidl y declines when they operate in
different driving conditions [8]. Consequently, other control
strategies such as PID, LQR, and sliding mode controllers with
feedforward action have been proposed as alternate schemes
for lateral control of a vehicle [9], [10]. In these controllers,the feedback controller is designed to reduce the tracking
error whereas the feedforward action is developed to counter
path curvature. However, LQR controllers might not be robustwith respect to parameter uncertainties, where even small
changes in the plant paramet ers could lead to closed-loop
instability [11]. Tuning of PID controllers is not a trivial
task making these control strategies difﬁcult to apply over a
wide range of path-tracking situations [1]–[3], [5]. Classicalsliding-mode controllers suffer from chattering phenomenon.
However, this limitation can be overcome with the use of
higher order techniques [12], [13] but at the cost of a morecomplicated design and closed-loop analysis [14]. With an

DIXIT et al. : INTEGRAL MRAC WITH BOUNDED SWITCHING GAIN FOR VEHICLE LATERAL TRACKING 1937
increase in available computational resources and develop-
ment of efﬁcient optimization solvers, advanced model-based
control techniques [e.g., model predictive control (MPC)]
are also employed for lateral control of a vehicle [15]–[17].MPC controllers ranging from standard linear MPC, linear
time-varying (LTV) MPC, and highly complex controllers
based on nonlinear vehicle and tire models are available in lit-erature [18], [19]. These advanced control techniques improve
tracking performance but their tracking performance is highly
sensitive to the accuracy of the system model and hence makes
them unsuitable in all driving conditions. The issue of model
error is mitigated by nonlinear MPC’s but these controllersrequire large computing resources which makes them imprac-
tical for most of the automotive platforms. Recently, active
research to augment the abovementioned control techniqueswith advancements such as neur al network, fuzzy logic, etc.
to further enhance their applicability and performance has
gained great momentum [20]–[24]. However, these techniques
rely heavily on readily available training data which is not
easily obtainable in the automotive industry. Nevertheless, thedifﬁculties in estimation of system parameters and presence
of rapidly changi ng dynamics due to nonlinearities such as
tire dynamics, longitudinal velocity, external disturbances, etc.make vehicle lateral control very challenging problem.
The theoretical framework for adaptive control was
formulated over seven decades ago and since then it has been
a topic of active research especially for systems that have
large dynamic variations and parameter uncertainties [25].Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is a well-known
adaptive control design method and is based on the objective
of ensuring that the controlled variables of a plant track agiven reference model. This control technique is backed by
an established theoretical framework and has proven to be a
viable control technique especia lly for systems where real-time
model parameters are unknown [25]. To improve the tracking
of the reference model despite un-modeled system dynamics,system nonlinearities, and rapid varying disturbances, in [26],
an adaptive integral control action and an adaptive switching
control action were added to the standard feedback andfeedforward MRAC strategy. The augmented MRAC, also
known in the literature as Enhanced MRAC (EMRAC) [27]
(see Fig. 1 for a representation of EMRAC closed-loop
control scheme) has shown to be effective at imposing
dynamics of the reference model to plants of engineeringinterest affected by model uncertainties and disturbances such
as electronic throttle body [26], common rail systems [28],
thermo-hygrometric control [29]. Despite MRAC strategiesbeing effective solutions to impose the required reference
dynamics with a limited knowledge of the plant parameters,
external disturbances may occasionally induce a drift of theadaptive gains, which can eventu ally lead to degraded tracking
performance and/or loss of closed-loop stability [25]. In [30],
two different methods namely: 1) parameter-projection and
2)σ-modiﬁcation were suggested to prevent unbounded
drift of the feedback, feedforward, and integral controlgains for systems. The paramet er-projection-based scheme
demonstrated its capability to provide asymptotic zero-tracking
error and boundedness of adaptive gains even when subjectedFig. 1. EMRAC control scheme [27], [29].
to transient distu rbances. Moreover, when the system
encounters time-bounded disturbances, the σ-modiﬁcation
scheme guarantees ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop
system when subjected to persistent disturbances. However,
only heuristic solutions (saturations) have been suggested to
bind the adaptive gain of the switching action [31].
Notwithstanding its ability to handle parameter variations,
system nonlinearities, and general control ﬂexibility, MRAC
schemes for lateral control of a vehicle are marginally studied
in literature [32]–[34]. One of the reasons is the concern of
unbounded drift of the controller g ains leading to instability
[35]. To prevent unbounded evolution of adaptive controller
gains, barrier Lyapunov functions and constraints on estimated
adaptive gains in [36] and a set- theoretic approach have been
presented in [37]. In this article, the σ-modiﬁcation framework
to guarantee bounds on the adaptive control gains discussed
above is extended to systematically bind the possible drift of
the adaptive gain of the switching action of the EMRAC.
The closed-loop system is a piecewise smooth system andthe uniform ultimate boundedness of all the closed-loop sig-
nals including adaptive gains is proven using the extended
Lyapunov theory for nonsmooth systems [38]. Moreover,the ultimate bound is computed using the above-mentioned
extended Lyapunov theory [39], [40]. Finally, the adaptive
control design is applied to the vehicle path-tracking/lateral
control problem. The closed-loop system is implemented on
an IPG Carmaker-Simulink co-simulation environment and itsbehavior in different driving conditions is investigated. The
reference model for the lateral-tracking problem is based on
a path-tracking bicycle model from literature [41], [42]. Thestates of this system capture the dynamics of both, lateral-yaw
motion of the vehicle as well as the path deviation errors.
A stable reference model is obtained by designing a feedbackcontroller using pole placement for stability along with a
feedforward action based on re quired steady-state cornering
behavior of the vehicle to counter the reference path curva-
ture. This reference model describes the preferred dynamical
behavior of the system for achieving stable cornering whileaccurately tracking any given ref erence path curvature that
the vehicle might encounter during normal highway driving
scenarios.

ATHEMATICAL NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS
The signum function of a real number xis deﬁned as
sgn(x)=(d/dx)|x|,x/negationslash=0. For a symmetric matrix M
and vector x,/bardblx/bardblMdenotes the weighted norm given by
/bardblx/bardblM=(xTMx)1/2,/bardblx/bardbldenotes the 2-norm of a vector,
andλmin(M)andλmax(M)are the minimum and maximum
eigenvalue of M, respectively. The matrix On,m∈Rn×m
denotes a matrix of zeros, and matrix In∈Rn×ndenotes the
identity matrix in Rn. For a given vector x,d i a g(x)represents
a diagonal matrix with xas its diagonal. L∞is the set of
bounded scalar function. Given a nonsmooth time-varying
system of the form
˙˜x=F(t,˜x) (1)
where ˜x∈Rnis the state of system and F:R×Rn→Rnis
the discontinuous vector ﬁeld. F ilippov solutions and the con-
cept of differential inclusions allow solutions to be deﬁned atpoints of discontinuities in the vector ﬁeld F(t,˜x). According
to [38] and [43], a vector function ˜x(·)is a Filippov solution
of the system (1) for t∈[t
0,t1]if: 1) ˜x(·)is absolutely
continuous and 2) for almost all t∈[t0,t1]
˙˜x∈K[F](t,˜x) (2)
with K[F](t,˜x)being the Filippov set valued map deﬁned as
K[F](˜x)/defines/intersectiondisplay

where/intersectiontext
π(S)=0denotes the intersection of all sets Sof
Lebesgue measure zero, B(˜x,υ) is the open ball centered
at˜xwith radius υ> 0, and
 co denotes the convex closure.
Moreover, systems of type (1) with discontinuous right-hand
sides also result in nonsmooth Lyapunov functions which hin-ders the use of standard stability theory proofs [38]. Clarke’s
generalized gradient presented in detail in [44] is a powerful
tool that can be used to streamline proofs for nonsmoothanalysis. For a globally Lipschitz function V:R
n×R→R,
the generalized gradient of Vat(˜x,t)is given by
∂V(˜x,t)=
co{lim∇V(˜x,t)|(˜xi,ti)→(˜x,t),(˜xi,ti)/∈/Xi1V}
(4)
where /Xi1Vis the set of measure zero where the gradient of
Vis not deﬁned [38]. It is noteworthy that Lipschitz means
Lipschitz in (˜x,t)and discontinuities in tare not allowed.Furthermore, if V(˜x,t)has no explicit dependence on t,
the last component of ∂Vcan be dropped as it is zero. The
generalized directional derivative of Vis deﬁned in [38] as
V◦(˜x;γ)=lim
˜y→˜x,sup
t↓0V(˜y+tγ)−V(˜y)
t(5)
and if Vis Lipschitz near ˜x,t h e n
V◦(˜x;γ)=max{ξTγ|ξ∈∂V(˜x)}. (6)
Thus, using the deﬁnitions in (5), (6), a function Vis called
a regular function if the following two conditions are ful-ﬁlled [38].
1)∀γ, the one-sided directional derivative of V
/prime(˜x;γ)
exists.
2)∀γ,V/prime(˜x;γ)=V◦(˜x;γ).
According to [38, Th. 2.2] if ˜x(·)is a solution to (1) and
V(˜x,t)is a regular function, then (d/dt)V(˜x,t)exists almost
everywhere and it can be computed as
d
dtV(˜x,t)∈a.e˙˜V(˜x,t) (7)
where
˙˜V=/intersectiondisplay

. (8)
The solutions of the system in the form (1) are said to
be uniformly ultimately bounded [45] if there exists a timeinterval T[dependent on ˜x(t
0)]a n da KL−class function
/Psi1:R+×R+→R+such that
/bardbl˜x(t)/bardbl≤/Psi1(/bardbl˜x(t0)/bardbl,t−t0)∀t∈[t0,t0+T] (9a)
and:
/bardbl˜x/bardbl≤/epsilon1∀t∈[t0+T,+∞[ and/epsilon1>0. (9b)
The aforementioned deﬁnitions and theorems have been
recently used in [46] to formulate the conditions that guar-
antee the ultimate boundedness of the discontinuous system
described in (1) and the main theorem is reported below.
Theorem 1: Assume that for any initial condition, the dif-
ferential inclusion (2) for system (1) is well-posed in the
sense of Filippov solutions, and there exists a positive globallyLipschitz continuous function V:R
n×R+→R, two positive
functions W1,W2∈K∞,a n d W3∈Ksuch that
W1(˜x)≤V(˜x,t)≤W2(˜x) (10a)

s.t.˙˜V(˜x,t)≤− W3(˜x),when /bardbl˜x/bardbl≥μ (10b)
with˙˜V(˜x,t)being the generalized gradient of V, then the
nonsmooth system in (1) is gl obally uniformly ultimately
bounded and the ultimate bound is given by W−1
1(W2(μ)).
It is noteworthy that Theorem 1 is a special case of [46, Th.3.1] by assuming: 1) zero time delays; 2) the solution of the
differential inclusion (2) exists for any initial condition; and
3)V(˜x,t)is deﬁned over the entire R
n.

III. C ONTROL FORMULATION
Consider a plant modeled in the form
˙x=Ax+B1u+B2r+d (11)
where x∈Rn,u∈R,r∈R,a n d d∈Rnare the state,
actuated input, un-actuated input, and the disturbance of the
system, respectively. The dis turbance acting on the plant is
assumed to belong to L∞, thus there exists /Delta1∞such that
/bardbld/bardbl</Delta1 ∞. The structure of the system matrices A∈Rn×n,
B1∈Rn,a n d B2∈Rnare assumed to be known and
constructed from the nominal parameters of the given system.
The control objective is to steer the dynamics of the system
(11) toward those of an asymptotically stable linear time-invariant (LTI) reference system of the form
˙x
m=Amxm+Bmr (12)
where xm∈Rnis the reference model state, and Am∈
Rn×n,Bm∈Rnare the reference model system matrices
with Ambeing Hurwitz. By assuming that there exist two

Rsuch that the following matching
conditions are satisﬁed :
Am=A+B1K∗

Bm=B1K∗
R+B2 (13b)
the aforementioned model reference control problem is solved
by the EMRAC control action
u(t)=KX(t)x(t)+KR(t)r(t)+KI(t)eI(t)
+KN(t)sgn(ye(t)) (14)
where the state tracking error is deﬁned as
e=xm−x (15)
and eIis the integral of the state tracking error e. The output
error yeis deﬁned as
ye=Cee,with Ce=BT

mP=− Q (16)
with Qbeing a positive deﬁnite matrix and Pthe solution of
the Lyapunov equation (16) which exists as Amis Hurwitz.
The adaptive control gains KX,KR,a n d KIare computed as
in [30]. Differing from the solutions available in literature,in this work K
Nis bounded by including the σ-modiﬁcation
strategy into the adaptive law of KN, thus avoiding the use
of heuristic solutions (saturations of the gain). A solution tobound positive increasing adaptive gains via σ-modiﬁcation
has been also proposed in [47]. Hence, K
Nis adapted as
KN=φNand˙φN=αN|ye|+ fN (17)
where αNis a positive constant, αN|ye|is the adaptive law for
φNin [29], and fNis the σ-modiﬁcation term deﬁned as

Theorem 2: Consider system (11) with r,d∈L∞and the
reference model (12). Let the adaptive control action be given
by (14), with the adaptive gain for the discontinuous action
computed as in (17). Then all resultant closed-loop signals are
bounded and the state of the closed-loop system is globallyuniformly ultimately bounded.
Before providing the proof for Theorem 2, the following
lemma is given.

the equation above can be expressed as

1940 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 29, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2021
1) Closed-Loop Dynamics: By considering the plant in
(11), the reference model in (12) , the control action in (14),
and the matching condition in (13), after some algebraic
manipulations, the closed-loop dynamics can be expressed as

andφebeing the vector collecting the mismatches between the
plant parameters and the integ ral parts of the adaptive gains
KX,KR,a n d KI(see [30] for its mathematical deﬁnition),
/Gamma1αand/Gamma1β∈R(2n+1)×(2n+1)are the positive matrices rep-
resenting the adaptive weights for the integral part and theproportional part of K
X,KR,a n d KI, repectively, and fis
theσ-modiﬁcation limiting the evolution of their integral part
(see [30] for its mathematical deﬁnition). It is noteworthy
that due to the discontinuities arising from the switching
action of the controller, the vector ﬁeld in (25) expressed asF:R×R
3n+2→R3n+2is a piecewise system. Thus, using
the mathematical formulation in (1) and (2), the closed-loop
system in (25) can be described by the differential inclusion
˙˜x∈K[F](˜x) (26)
where K[F](˜x)represents the Filippov set-valued map of the
piecewise system and ˜xT=[eT,φT
e,φNe].
2) Existence of Candidate Lyapunov Function V : The can-
didate Lyapunov function is
V(˜x)=˜xT˜P˜x (27)
where ˜P=diag(P,/Gamma1−1
α,α−1
N), with Pbeing the solution of
the Lyapunov equation in (16). It is noteworthy that (27) can
be bounded as [30], [45]
W1(˜x)≤V(˜x)≤W2(˜x) (28)
where W1(˜x)=λmin(˜P)/bardbl˜x/bardbl2and W2(˜x)=λmax(˜P)/bardbl˜x/bardbl2.
AsVis a smooth function and by extension a regular function
[38], [45], [46], (d/dt)V(˜x)exists and can be computed as
in (7). Therefore, using (26) the derivative of (27) along theclosed-loop trajectories (25) can be expressed as
d
dtV(˜x)∈a.e˙˜V(˜x)=/intersectiondisplay
ξ∈∂V(˜x)ξTK[F](˜x). (29)
According to [38], since V(˜x)is a smooth function
˙˜V(˜x)=∇ VT·K[F](˜x)=2˜xT˜PK[F](˜x) (30)the differential inclusion K[F](˜x)in (26) can be expanded as

(31b)
After some algebraic manipulations, using the Lyapunov equa-
tion in (16), and the differential inclusion in (31) the right-hand
side of (30) is

as

Since, the set-valued map is used to deal with the discontinu-

is considered for the condition when ye=0. After some
further algebraic manipulation, (32) can be upper bounded as

It is noted that, to obtain (34), the term 2 yeφNeK[sgn(ye)]is

when ye=0. The ﬁrst three terms on the right-hand side of
(34) have been considered in [30] and the equation above can
be further manipulated as in [30, Proof of Theorem 2] using

IV . S YSTEM MODEL
A. Path-Tracking Model
The primary objective of a path-tracking controller is to
accurately follow the reference path under a wide range of
operating conditions. Path tracking for autonomous vehicles
is a particularly challenging task as the dynamics of a vehiclechange signiﬁcantly with changes in longitudinal velocity, road
surface, and external disturbances such as wind, challenging
maneuvers, etc. The initial generation of path-tracking con-
trollers were based on geometric controllers (e.g., Stanley,
follow the carrot, etc.) and were shown to provide suitableperformance under nominal cond itions both in simulation and
real-world experiments. However, their performance suffers
when the system deviates far from nominal conditions andthus prompted researchers to d evelop more advanced control
algorithms (e.g., sliding mode control, robust control, adaptive
control, MPC, etc.) that were suitable for the complex nature ofthe problem. In this section, the path-following system model
is presented for application of the control law in (14) to a
vehicle’s lateral control problem is discussed. To apply the
control law in (14), the relevant vehicle and error states of
the system need to be expressed in the format given in (11).To capture the lateral and yaw dynamics of the autonomous
vehicle, the single-track dynamic bicycle model of the vehicle
is utilized (see Fig. 2). The vehicle’s lateral velocity v
yandyaw rate rzare used to get a representation of the vehicle’s
dynamics. Additional states tha t are augmented to this model
are, the lateral position error deﬁned as the lateral distance
error from the Center of Gravity (CG) of the vehicle fromthe desired path η
e, measured perpendicularly to the vehicle’s
orientation and the heading angle error ψe, deﬁned as the dif-
ference between the orientation of the vehicle and the desiredyaw angle. The equations that describe the evolution of the
four states have been presented in [41] and [48] and have also
been used by researchers to devel op their lateral-yaw tracking
controller for autonomous vehicles [41]. Hence, by deﬁning

B. Steering Actuator Dynamics
Path-tracking controllers are generally designed under the
assumption that the desired front wheel steering angle com-
puted by the controller is immediately applied on the vehicle.In human-driven vehicles, the d esired steering wheel angle is
provided by the driver which is then transmitted to the front
wheels using mechanical linka ges and gears. On the other
hand, in vehicles equipped with a steering actuator, the desired
steering wheel angle is applied by means of a motor and
transmission to actuate the front wheel angle. Consequently,
this actuator (steering system) has its own dynamics and
might lead to reduced closed-l oop tracking performance if
not incorporated within the control design. It is common
practice to represent the actuator dynamics by approximating
them as low-order transfer functions (e.g., ﬁrst/second orderlow-pass ﬁlters) [49] but for the test vehicle used in this article,
simulation and experimental tests in the past have shown that
the dynamics of its steering system can be approximated as a
pure delay modeled as
δ
f(t)=δf,des(t−τsa) (43)
where τsais the actuator time-delay and δf,desis the desired
front steering angle. A schematic representation of such a
steering actuator system is given in Fig. 3. For the control

is utilized for control design. Furthermore, for a given nominal
delay that is, τsa=¯τsa, the transfer function in (44) can be
represented in a state-space domain as
˙xsa=Asaxsa+Bsausa (45a)
ysa=Csaxsa+Dsausa (45b)
where xsa∈Ris an internal state for the actuator dynamics,

input of the system, the actual front steering angle ysa=δf∈
Ris the output of the system, and (Asa,Bsa,Csa,Dsa)are the
state-space matrices of appropriate dimensions.
C. Augmented System
The steering actuator model in (45) is coupled with the
path-tracking model in (41) to obtain an integrated model of
the overall system. By denoting x=[xT
path,xT
sa]T∈R5as the
state vector of the system, and u=δf,des∈Ras the input to
the system, the resulting coupled model is
˙x=Ax+B1u+B2κ (46)

For normal road-going vehicle, the system matrix Ain (46)
has three poles in the left-half plane (steering actuator state
and stable lateral dynamics of understeered vehicle) and twopoles in the origin (i.e., because of error states), resulting in
an unstable system.
It is noteworthy that the dynamics of system (46) depend
on the longitudinal velocity and the vehicle parameters (mass,
weight distribution, moment of inertia, tire cornering stiffness,etc.) and generally nominal values of these parameters are
used to create the system model. Moreover, coupling the
approximate steering actuator dynamics introduces additionalmodeling uncertainties to the stat e-space model. Therefore, the
coupled system dynamics are represented more realistically by
˙x=Ax+B
1u+B2κ+d (48)
where d∈Ris a bounded disturbance acting upon the
system and contains the deviation between a nominal system
model and the actual system due to modeling mismatch,
parameter variation, external disturbances, degradation, etc.Hence, system (48) matches the structure in (11). Moreover,

Hence, the disturbance dis a function of the states, input,
and parameter variation can be expressed as d=d(x,u,κ,p)
where pis the vector of system parameters (e.g., Cf,Cr,lf,
lr, etc.). While the nominal valu es of these parameters can be
chosen during the design of the nominal model, estimating
these parameters accurately in real-world conditions is not
a trivial task. However, the bounds on the variation in each
parameter can be obtained based on the operating regimes thatthe vehicle is expected to be subjected to. The bounds can then
be used to derive the bounds of the disturbance /Delta1
∞.
V. P ATH-TRACKING CONTROLLER DESIGN
The design of path-tracking controller starts with the selec-
tion of a reference model which can be represented as in (12).
To this aim, the closed-loop dynamics of the nominal system(46) under a linear control action are exploited. In accordance
to [41], the linear control action can be expressed as
u=K
X(vx)x+KR(vx,κ)κ. (50)
The application of the control law (50) for a given set of
nominal vehicle parameters a nd a given longitudinal speed
results in the following closed-loop dynamics of the system

It is noted that, in the case of absence of disturbances (such
as wind gusts) and perfect knowledge of the vehicle parame-
ters, the linear control actions of the form (50) provide accu-rate path tracking. The feedback control is used to stabilize the
system and achieve desired pat h-tracking pe rformance, while
the feedforward action is utilized to counter the road curvature
which act as an unactuated control input and theoretically
achieve zero steady-state lateral position error also when κis
very large (representing tight highway turns/curves). Further-
more, successful implementation of the resultant closed-loop
system in experimental tests have demonstrated their ability at

tracking the curvature of tight highway corners under medium
to high-speed driving (70–120 km h−1)scenarios. However,
due to the controlled nature of the testing environments,it is yet to be seen how they cope with variations such as
rapidly changing road friction, wind gusts, vehicle parameter
variations, etc. which are possible scenarios an autonomous
vehicle will face during its operation beyond controlled test
environments. It is noteworthy, that from an occupant accep-tance point of view, it will be advantageous to have a system
that can provide uniformity in its behavior despite changes in
system parameters or external perturbations, that is, the vehicleshould perform a given maneuver in a uniform manner under
different internal and/or external perturbations.
To achieve the performance objectives mentioned above,
an EMRAC-based control formulation presented in Section III
is designed. For a system model described as (48), the controllaw in (14)–(18) is developed to compute control inputs for
accurate path tracking. Within this framework, the bounded-
ness of the adaptive gains is ensured using the σ-modiﬁcation
technique which means that the inputs and states will not
need to be artiﬁcially saturated like previous implementations
of MRAC in autonomous vehicles [32]–[34]. The resultant
closed-loop path-tracking control structure is illustrated in
Fig. 4, where the block Reference Curvature Generator is used
to create the reference curvature to the reference model (51).
Details about the technique adopted for generating the local
reference curvature κ
refare given in Appendix A. Moreover,
as the proposed controller is designed for steering control, it is
assumed that a separate longitudinal tracking controller (such
as a vehicle’s adaptive cruise control) system is utilized for
velocity tracking.
Some important features of the closed-loop architecture in
Fig. 4 and EMRAC controller design are listed below.
Remarks:
1) The lateral distance error required to compute the refer-
ence road curvature is computed based on a look-ahead
policy and details on the selection of the look-aheaddistance are given in Appendix B.
2) The presence of the discontinuous switching action
in (14) can introduce chattering phenomena (high-frequency switching of the control action). To miti-
gate this undesirable behavior, the discontinuous control

UMERICAL VALIDATION
In this section, the ability of the proposed architecture
(local reference generation and tracking controller) in Fig. 4 to
accurately track a desired path/c urvature around the test-track
is discussed. The validation of the control law in (14)–(18) to impose the desired vehicle lateral and yaw dynamics
while following a desired path is done in a MATLAB-IPG
CarMaker co-simulation environment. The path chosen is partof a test-track that consists of corners of different curvatures
interspersed with straights. The (x,y)coordinates of the center
of the track are known and act as the reference path for the
vehicle to follow. These coordinates can be used to compute
the desired path curvature as a function of distance traveledalong path using the equation from [50] given below
κ
des=ξ/primeη/prime/prime−η/primeξ/prime/prime
[(ξ/prime)2+(η/prime)2]3
2(53)
where ξis the x-coordinate in inertial frame, ηis the
y-coordinate in inertial frame, and (·)/primerepresents the derivative
with respect to path length. The resultant desired path cur-
vature for the test-track obtained using the equation above isshown in Fig. 5(a). The resultant path and environment are cre-
ated in the high-ﬁdelity IPG CarMaker platform. Moreover, the
desired velocity proﬁle of the vehicle is known [see Fig. 5(b)]
and provided to the default IPG CarMaker’s Adaptive Cruise
Controller (ACC) system.
The simpliﬁed system model in (41) is created using the
nominal vehicle parameters obtained from the IPG vehicle
model. A reference model of the form (51) is created in twosteps namely: 1) the feedback controller is designed using the
pole placement method by introducing two stable poles for the
error states while keeping the stable poles of v
y,rzintact and
2) computing a reference feedforward based on the method
described from [48], see Appendix C-A. The EMRAC is thendesigned using the techniques discussed in Section III and
the resultant control law is connected in closed-loop with the
high-ﬁdelity vehicle and system model from IPG CarMaker.This resultant closed-loop architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4
and thus can be used for numerical validation of the proposed
lateral-tracking controller. The controller is designed usingthe parameters in Table I with the goal of driving along the
center of the track as closely as possible despite variations
in the vehicle’s velocity and other system uncertainties. It is
noteworthy that the nominal controllers for reference model
of the EMRAC are designed using the procedure described inAppendixes B and C.
Moreover, since the eventual goal is to test and validate the
control scheme on an experimental vehicle, the high-ﬁdelity

environment is set-up to mimic the sampling times of the con-
troller area network (CAN) bus and the vehicle actuators. As a
result the co-simulation environment is discretised at 1000 Hz
whereas the EMRAC controller is discretised at 50 Hz.
A. Case I: Desired Path Tracking
In this section, the ability of the proposed architecture
(local reference generation and tracking controller) in Fig. 4
to accurately track a desired path /curvature around a test-track
is discussed. Fig. 5(a) shows that the test-track consists ofthree corners with different cur vatures interlaced with straight
driving sections. Moreover, the desired longitudinal velocity
v
desshown in Fig. 5(b) is varying which means that the
lateral-yaw dynamics of the vehicle are different for each
corner and the controller autom atically adapt its gains to
accommodate such variations. At each point on the track, the
reference curvature κrefis computed based on Appendix A
and provided to the EMRAC later al-tracking controller which
calculates the appropriate front steering angle δf,desfor the
vehicle. This desired front steer angle is the input for the
steering actuator and based on its dynamics, the actual frontsteering angle δ
fis applied to the vehicle.
The evolution of the internal states of the EMRAC controller
is shown in Fig. 6 and some key takeaways are as follows. The
plots show that while cornering there is some error between the
states of the vehicle and ref erence model within the MRAC,
this error is the largest during the ﬁrst corner but then as the
controller gains adapt [see also Fig. 8(b) and (c)] it reduces
over the rest of the simulation despite the last corner beingthe tightest. During the ﬁrst corner, the lateral velocity of
the vehicle v
ydoes not match the reference model and this
can be traced as the cause for the additional initial lateral
error ηe, see Fig. 6(a) and (c). However, the plots show
thatηedoes not grow beyond 0.1 m and also progressively
reduces as the simulation goes on. While navigating the ﬁrst
corner, the vehicle is traveling at very close to the nominal
longitudinal velocity [see Fig. 5(b)] and as a result the yaw-rateFig. 6. Evolution of the EMRAC states a nd errors for driving on test-track.

of the vehicle matches the reference model in Fig. 6(b).
For the remaining two corners, the longitudinal velocity islower and as a result the vehicle’s yaw-rate is lower when
compared to the reference mode l. Moreover, Fig. 6(d) shows
that there exists a constant mismatch between the heading
angle error of the vehicle and the reference model. However,
some of these discrepancies can be contributed to the twoassumptions made within the path-tracking model namely:
1) the tires do not generate any lateral-slip and 2) no side-slip
of the vehicle body. From Fig. 6(e) it is observed that thediscrepancy between the reference model and the actual state
is the least among all states in case of the internal steering
actuator state. This is expected as the steering actuator state isgenerated using (45) which exactly matches the model within
the EMRAC controller. The closed-loop tracking performance
of the EMRAC states in Fig. 6 shows that the vehicle is able to
closely follow the reference model despite the simpliﬁcations
and assumptions made while modeling path-tracking dynamicsas well as the steering actuator dynamics and thus demonstrate
that the EMRAC design procedure is ﬂexible and can be
used when steering actuator dynamics are incorporated intocontroller design for lateral-tracking controllers.

The discussion above shows that the EMRAC controller per-
forms satisfactorily after being modiﬁed with steering actuatordynamics. Moreover, the overall path-tracking performance of
the closed-loop architecture from Fig. 4 (EMRAC controller
when coupled with a local path/trajectory re-planning) isillustrated in Fig. 7. The plot of the coordinates of the path
and the center of gravity of the vehicle in Fig. 7(a) shows
that the vehicle can follow a gi ven desired path accurately.
The plot inset which depicts a closer view of the tightest
ﬁnal corner also illustrates that the coordinates of the pathand vehicle are indistinguishable at these scales. The desired
path curvature κ
des, the reference curvature κrefgenerated as in
Appendix A, and the curvature followed by vehicle ( κ≈rz/v)
in Fig. 7(b) shows that the refere nce curvature generated from
circular arcs is a very close match to the desired path curvature.
Moreover, the vehicle is able to track the reference curvature
very accurately all along the test-track, thus demonstrating theability of the proposed closed-loop architecture as a capable
path-tracking solution. The plot inset in Fig. 7(b) provides a
closer look at the ability of the closed-loop control system inpreventing the vehicle from deviating far from the desired path.
The usage of a look-ahead-point for generating a reference
path/curvature also results in a vehicle cutting corners and
this phenomenon is also clearly visible in the inset where the
reference curvature and vehicle’s curvature signal clearly cutthe peak of the desired curvature signal. Finally, the variation
of the longitudinal velocity vof the vehicle is depicted in
Fig. 7(c). The tracking performance of the longitudinal veloc-ity controller is sufﬁcient for the purposes of this study and a
detailed discussion on it is beyond the scope of this article.
The control action δ
f,descomputed using the EMRAC
algorithm is given in Fig. 8(a). The presence of some oscil-
lations can be observed during the ﬁrst corner but theyare quickly attenuated as the gains of the controller adapt
[see Fig. 8(b) and (c)]. Consequently, the steering action in
the remaining part of the simulation is devoid of anyhigh-frequency oscillatory beha vior that would have a detri-
mental effect on the occupant comfort and lateral-yaw stability
of the vehicle. Furthermore, the plot shows that the control
action for transitioning from straight driving to cornering gets
increasingly smoother with each corner despite the reference
curvature being the largest (s mallest cornering radius) for
the ﬁnal corner. The evolution of the adaptive gains for the
continuous part of the control action (i.e., K

action varies throughout the test t o accurately track paths of
different curvatures. Moreover, the large rise in the gain KR

track but the plots also show the adaptive gains decreasing atthe very end once the corner has been completed. The bounded

gain when it is activated.
B. Case II: Robustness to Actuator Dynamics
To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
lateral-tracking controller to deviation of steering actuator
dynamics from nominal conditions, the simulation with thesame controller is repeated twice with: 1) no steering actuator
dynamics, that is, δ
f,des(τsa=0) is applied directly to the
vehicle and 2) the delay of the st eering actuator is larger than
modeled delay by 25% ( τsa=1.25¯τsa). The comparison of the
simulation results between the nominal case in Section VI-Aand the two cases mentioned above provide insight on the
performance of the proposed controller to variations in
steering actuator dynamics. It is noteworthy that for each ofthe runs, the adaptive gains of the controller are initialized to
the default value at the start of the simulation.
The plot of the respective cross-track error η
xt(see Fig. 13
for deﬁnition of cross-track error) from each simulation is
plotted in Fig. 9(a) and can be used to compare the closed-loop
performance. Firstly, the plot shows that ηxtis virtually
identical for the three scenarios which shows that the proposed
control algorithm is robust to variations in time-delay ofthe steering actuator system and the magnitude of η
xtin
all the three simulations is within the acceptable range for
path-following techniques for autonomous vehicle. Secondly,Fig. 9. Comparison of simulation resu lts for tracking desired coordinates

the phenomenon of cutting the corners (due to look-ahead
point) which was discussed above in Fig. 7(b) is more clearlyevident in the plot of the cross-track error. The cutting of
corners is evident at the start and end of each corner (e.g.,
t≈{10,40,70,100,120,220,270}s) of Fig. 9(a). As the
vehicle is turning right, cutting the corner at the start of the
curve results in positive error contribution to η
xtand a negative
contribution to ηxtat the end of the corner. The steering
actuation computed by controller for the three simulation
runs is illustrated in Fig. 9(b). The three signals are virtuallyindistinguishable from each ot her with the only perceptible
difference being at the start of the ﬁrst corner where the
control action for the largest delay in the steering actuator sys-
tem shows some high-frequency oscillations. However, these
oscillations are quickly terminated and the signal demonstratessmooth evolution for the remaining duration of the test. Since
the control action changes slightly even when the delay within
the steering system varies, it is safe to infer that the othersignals such as the states of the EMRAC controller, gains
of the controller, etc. also evolve just like the nominal case.
This is conﬁrmed by the simulations, but the evolution of
such signals are not reported here for the sake of brevity.
Therefore, these results help in highlighting the robustnessof the proposed lateral-tracking controller to variations in the
dynamics of the steering actuator system.
C. Case III: Robustness to Uncertainties and Disturbances
The results discussed in this section so far demonstrate the
ability of the proposed control architecture to successfully
perform a path-tracking under nominal conditions or slow
variations in system parameters. However, in real world sce-
narios an autonomous vehicle might enc ounter conditions that
have not (or cannot) be considered for controller development.As a result, it is important to study the robustness of the
closed-loop system when subjected to un-modeled environ-
mental disturbances. The conditions are modiﬁed as follows:

seats of the vehicle. A screen-shot of the road conditions areillustrated in Fig. 10 and the location of the wind-gusts are
shown in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11 it is evident that the wind
gusts are experienced when the v ehicle is in four different
stages of driving: 1) E1—mid-corner; 2) E2—corner exit; 3)
E3—straight driving; and 4) E4—corner entry. Moreover, the
description of the side-wind events mentioned in Fig. 10 are
provided in Table II. The resultant environment thus creates a
scenario when the each tire of the vehicle keeps transitioningbetween nominal, wet, and icy road (thereby changing their
lateral stiffness coefﬁcient), the additional passengers alter the
mass and moment of inertia of the vehicle from the nominalvalues, and the sudden wind gust can potentially veer the
vehicle of the desired path causing a safety breach if not
countered by the controller. This scenario is simulated with the
controller unchanged (including the tuning and initialization
parameters for adaptive gains) and the results obtained fromthe closed-loop simulation are discussed below.
The plot of the cross-track error in Fig. 12(a) illustrates the
difference in the performance of the closed-loop system duringFig. 12. Comparison of simulation resu lts for tracking desired coordinates

nominal conditions in Section VI-A and the one described
above with split- μand wind-gusts. The plot shows that the
tracking performance is nearly identical for most of the test-
run. The only visual differences present represent the slight
deviation in the path of the vehicle when subjected to wind
gusts. On the other hand despite the split- μconditions the
tracking error remains identical during the different corners
demonstrating the ability of the proposed controller against
variations in tire lateral stiffness.
The evolution of the norm of the adaptive gain for the
switching action /bardblφN/bardblover the course of the simulation
shown in Fig. 12(b) clearly demonstrates the impact of the
σ-modiﬁcation at changing the way to controller adapts over
time. Compared to the nominal conditions, the evolutionof/bardblφ
N/bardblfor the split- μ+wind-gust condition differs slightly
mainly at instances where the wind gust strikes the vehicle
and sudden control actions is necessary to: 1) stabilize thevehicle and 2) maintain clos ed-loop tracking performance.
Additionally, due to the leakag e-effect introduced via the
σ-modiﬁcation [see (18b)] the value of /bardblφ
N/bardblquickly restores
back to the same value as it was during the nominal test-run.
This demonstrates that the proposed control architecture canadapt the controller gains to counter rapid disturbances but the
σ-modiﬁcation technique ensures that the control reverts back
to the nominal behavior once the disturbance has ended.

Finally, Fig. 12(c) shows the front wheel angle (mean of
front-left and front-right) applied on the vehicle to track the
desired path. The plot shows that the front wheel angle during
the split- μ+wind gust conditions very closely matches the
nominal situation. The main differences lie in: 1) slightly
increased front wheel angle needed during steady-state corner-
ing which is due to the larger slip angle necessary to generatethe required lateral force in the tires to follow the given road
curvature and 2) changes in front wheel angle to prevent the
vehicle veering of the desired path during wind gusts. The
zoomed in plot inset further illustrates that the control action
is not very aggressive and the oscillation reduce rapidly oncethe disturbance has been countered.
The simulation results discussed in this section demonstrate
the efﬁcacy of lateral-tracking control architecture illustratedin Fig. 4. In addition to the closed-loop performance which
has already been discussed some additional key takeaways are
as follows: 1) the EMRAC generic lateral-tracking controller
can be augmented with steering actuator dynamics such
that the control law considers these additional dynamicswhile computing appropriate steering action; 2) the
EMRAC controller can be successfully coupled with a
local trajectory/curvature replanning method and thusincorporated within a larger autonomous vehicle driving
architecture; and 3) the EMRA C scheme with the switching
action containing σ-modiﬁcation is a viable strategy for
vehicle lateral tracking that can prevent loss of closed-loop
performance in a diverse set of operating regimes.
VII. C
ONCLUSION
Lateral tracking of an autonomous vehicle for following
a given reference path is a challenging task due to inherentaspects of the system such as external disturbances, system
nonlinearities, rapidly changing dynamics, etc. arising due to
tire dynamics, wind gusts, road surface changes, modelingmiss-matches, steering actuator dynamics, etc. In this arti-
cle, a generic lateral-trackin g controller has been designed
using an EMRAC strategy due to its ability to maintain
closed-loop performance even for systems that are affected by
the phenomenon mentioned above. Furthermore, a systematictechnique of binding the gain of the switching control action
of the EMRAC controller using σ-modiﬁcation strategy has
been presented. The ultimate boundedness of the resultingclosed-loop system is proven using an extended Lyapunov
theory for discontinuous systems. The effectiveness of the
EMRAC control framework with bounded adaptive gains
is numerically evaluated by des igning a lateral controller
for a vehicle and investigating the closed-loop performanceunder different scenarios in an IPG CarMaker-Simulink co-
simulation environment. The evaluation performed under dif-
ferent driving conditions showed that the proposed controllercan track the reference path ev en when the system is subjected
to large external disturbances, modeling errors, etc. while
ensuring bounded evolution of adaptive control gain of the
switching control action thus providing numeric validation of
the proposed method to conﬁne its dynamics. As part of futurework, the lateral-tracking controller investigated in this article
will be tested under a larger set of maneuvers and drivingFig. 13. Geometric representation of reference curvature generation from

conditions where the full state of the plant is not available, thus
requiring some of the adaptive control gains being excluded
from the computation of the control action as in [26], leadingto further experimental validation.

LOCAL REFERENCE CURV ATURE GENERATION
The lateral-tracking controller proposed in this article uses
the reference path curvature t o calculate the required front
wheel steering angle that is applied to follow a given path.
A computationally efﬁcient technique for estimating the refer-
ence curvature that a vehicle should follow to track a desiredpath is shown to be effective in experimental tests in [41].
This procedure which is brieﬂy discussed below is utilized to
generate the local reference curvature that can act as referencesignal for the EMRAC lateral-tracking controller. This method
relies on two phenomena observed for a vehicle in steady-state
cornering conditions at low later al accelerations namely: 1) in
steady-state conditions the later al motion of a vehicle follows
circular arcs and 2) the center of rotation of front-wheel steeredvehicles using Ackermann geometry lies on a virtual line
passing through the rear-axle of the vehicle [42]. Therefore,
the lateral error at a look-ahead distance can be reduced to zeroif the vehicle travels along a circular arc of a certain radius,
see Fig. 13 for a geometrical interpretation of the concept.
By assigning lateral error at the look-ahead point η
e,laas the
sagitta of the circular arc (starting from rear-axle) and utilizing
the net look-ahead distance from the rear axle as dla=lr+ξla,
the reference curvature of the arc κrefcan be estimated as
κref=2ηe,la
d2
la,when ηe,la/lessmuchRref (54)
where Rrefis the radius of the circular arc. Thus, the
path-following problem is transformed into a curvature follow-
ing problem which is suitable for the lateral-tracking controllerproposed in this article.
Remarks:
1) The cross-track error η
xtis deﬁned as the distance of the
center of gravity of the vehicle from the desired path (ofthe test-track). This distance is measured perpendicular
to the vehicle’s longitudinal axis.
2) The lateral position error η
e(/negationslash=ηxt)deﬁned in
Section IV-A is the lateral distance error from the CG
of the vehicle to the referen ce path and is also measured
perpendicular to the vehicle’s longitudinal axis.

APPENDIX B
DETERMINATION OF LOOK -AHEAD DISTANCE
The rationale behind the determination the look-ahead dis-
tanceξlais discussed below. For the augmented path-tracking
model described in (46) if the heading angle error ψeis
assumed to be small, the chord lengths can be approximated
as the arc length [42], see also Fig. 14. This assumption canbe used to deﬁne the lateral error at the look ahead point η
e,la
as
ηe,la=ηe+ξlaψe. (55)
Thus, from the output deﬁnition in (55) and the system
dynamics in (46) a transfer function Gyu(s)from input u=
δf,desto the output y=ηe,lais deﬁned.
A. Medium-Speed Driving
The poles and zeros of Gyu(s)for different values of
look-ahead distance ξlaare illustrated in Fig. 15. The model
has been generated using 15 .27 m s−1as the longitudinal
velocity. The plot shows that while the poles of the system are
unaffected by the value of ξla, the damping for the conjugate
zeros increases as ξlaincreases. Moreover, the nonminimum
phase zero which introduced in the system as a result of the
pure-time delay in the steerin g actuator and is not affected
byξlaeither. Thus, to prevent unwanted oscillations from
entering the system, a look-ahead distance ξla>0 is chosen
for computing the reference curvature for the path-trackingproblem presented in Section V. The ﬁnal value of the
look-ahead distance ξ
lais obtained by tuning to achieve a suit-
able compromise between tracking accuracy (corner cutting)and smoothness of control action.

DESIGN OF CONTROLLERS FOR REFERENCE MODEL
This section outlines the steps that are carried out to com-
pute the nominal controllers for the reference model withinthe EMRAC framework. The nominal controllers consist of a
feedback controller K

Rthat
are used to steer the dynamics of a system (46) toward thereference system (51). The control law used to achieve this is

which can be further simpliﬁed by deﬁning the matrix Am=
(A+B1K∗
X)resulting in the expression given below
˙x=Amx+B2κ. (58)
It is noteworthy that due to the presence of the term B2κ
while traveling on a curve, the error states will not converge
to zero even though Amis Hurwitz. This necessitates the need
of a feedforward term uff(in addition to the feedback) to
compensate for curved paths. The addition of uffto the control
action results in the closed-loop dynamics given below
˙x=Amx+B1uff+B2κ. (59)
By following steps similar to the ones presented in [42, Ch.
3], a feedforward action can be computed that results in
zero steady-state error for the lateral position ηe,ssbut cannot
inﬂuence the steady-state e rror for the heading angle error
ψe,ss=0. This resultant uffobtained using the Symbolic
Toolbox in MATLAB is a function of the model parameters
in the matrices (A,B1,B2), elements of the feedback control
matrix K∗
X, and the curvature κ. The expression of the function
is lengthy but it can be expressed in the compact uff=K∗
Rκ,
with K∗
Rbeing the feedforward gain.
B. Design of Reference Feedback Controller: K∗

In (56), the feedback controller is a full state feedback law.
The only prior condition for the design of the feedback lawis that the resultant closed-loop system dynamics need to be
stable (i.e., (A+B
1K∗
X)is Hurwitz). For this body of work, the
feedback controller is designed using the procedure presentedbelow.
For a given stabilizing feedback controller K
X, a feedfor-
ward controller KRcan be designed based on Section C-A.
For the resultant closed-loop system given as

identity matrix of appropriate dimensions. The deﬁnition of
the output vector is used to create transfer functions Gj1(s)
from input κto the jth output where j∈{1,..., 5}.
For the closed-loop system (60), it is desirable to minimizethe steady-state gain of the error outputs (i.e., η
eandψe)
and have favorable phase characteristics in high-frequency
regions. Moreover, since the steering dynamics are modeled as
