Abstract —With self-driving vehicles being pushed towards
the main-stream, there is an increasing motivation towards
development of systems that autonomously perform manoeu-
vres involving combined lateral-longitudinal motion (e.g., lane-
change, merge, overtake, etc.). This paper presents a situational
awareness and trajectory planning framework for performing
autonomous overtaking manoeuvres. A combination of a poten-
tial ﬁeld-like function and reachability sets of a vehicle are used
to identify safe zones on a road that the vehicle can navigate
towards. These safe zones are provided to a model predictive
controller as reference to generate feasible trajectories for a
vehicle. The strengths of the proposed framework are: (i) it
is free from non-convex collision avoidance constraints, (ii)
it ensures feasibility of trajectory, and (iii) it is real-time
implementable. A proof of concept simulation is shown to
demonstrate the ability to plan trajectories for high-speed
overtaking manoeuvres.
I. I NTRODUCTION
The ﬁrst generation of autonomous cars that demonstrated
their ability to perform tasks such as distance maintenance,
lane departure warning, etc. helped in improving safety on
highways, increase occupant comfort, and reduce the driver
workload [1]. However, they still rely on a human driver to
either initiate or intervene while performing more challenging
manoeuvres (e.g. lane-change, merge, overtake etc.). Over-
taking represents a template of such complex manoeuvres
as (i) it combines lateral and longitudinal motion of an
overtaking vehicle (subject vehicle) while avoiding collisions
with a slower moving obstacle vehicle (lead vehicle), and (ii)
it includes sub-manoeuvres i.e., lane-changing, lane-keeping,
and merging in a sequential manner [2] (see Fig. 1). Hence,
the development of autonomous overtaking systems is under
great focus since it unlocks the potential to perform a host
of different manoeuvres and helps achieve an important
milestone towards fully autonomous driving.

The inherently intricate structure of overtaking stems from
its dependence on a large number of factors such as road
condition, weather, trafﬁc condition, participating vehicles,
relative velocity, etc. [3]. Furthermore, each overtaking ma-
noeuvre is unique in terms of duration of the manoeuvre,
relative velocity between vehicles, etc. [4]–[6] thus making
classiﬁcation and standardisation difﬁcult. There are a variety
of diverse ways proposed in literature for planning safe
trajectories to perform an autonomous overtaking manoeuvre
by treating it as a moving-obstacle avoidance problem. A
detailed review of trajectory planning techniques for au-
tonomous overtaking is presented in [7] and some key
aspects are discussed below. Incremental search based algo-
rithms such as Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT) have
been proposed for planning safe trajectories for autonomous
overtaking [8]. Even though algorithms incorporating basic
vehicle kinematics within a RRT search algorithm have been
proposed, the planned trajectories can be jerky which could
lead to reduced occupant comfort. Furthermore, the computa-
tion times for most search based algorithms are dependent on
surrounding trafﬁc density thus making them unsuitable for
automotive applications [9]. If accurate knowledge of road
and surrounding obstacles is available, potential ﬁeld based
techniques are shown to be successful at generating collision2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)

free trajectories for avoiding obstacles [10]. However, while
guaranteeing collision free trajectories, potential ﬁeld based
methods do not incorporate vehicle dynamics and hence
cannot ensure feasibility of the planned trajectory [9]. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) helps address these shortcomings
with its ability to formulate vehicle dynamics and collision
avoidance constraints as a ﬁnite-horizon constrained optimi-
sation problem. However, collision avoidance constraints for
trajectory planning are generally non-convex which greatly
limits the feasibility and uniqueness of the solution to the
optimisation problem. Researchers rely on techniques such
as convexiﬁcation [11], change of reference frame [12], and
approximation [13] to address the issue. Nevertheless, the
optimisation problem formulated by these approaches often
require constraint equalities that change in real-time which
makes them difﬁcult to implement on a vehicles ECU. In
[14] the concept of motion primitives is included within
an MPC framework to plan collision avoidance trajectories.
However, since these motion primitives are computed ofﬂine
and accessed via a look-up table, only a subset of all
feasible trajectories are considered for motion planning. In
[2] overtaking trajectories are generated by directing the
vehicle along virtual target points located at safe distances
around the LV thus reformulating trajectory planning into a
navigation problem. A similar approach inspired from missile
guidance systems called Rendezvous Guidance is used to plan
a trajectory for an overtaking manoeuvre [15]. However, in all
these techniques the SV is modelled as a point mass with no
dynamics and hence these methods are unsuitable for high-
speed trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles.
In this paper, extracting the relevant beneﬁts of each ap-
proach described in the literature, we propose a mathematical
framework of potential ﬁeld-like functions and MPC for per-
forming an autonomous high-speed overtaking manoeuvre.
The framework is composed by three components (i) an
artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld, (ii) target generation block, and (iii)
a trajectory generation block. The artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld
is used to map the surrounding region of the SV based
on obstacles position, orientation, and relative velocity. At
every sampling instant, the target generation block identiﬁes
the safest point of the road which is compatible with the
dynamics of the SV and computes the reference state set
point (e.g., velocity, lateral position, and heading angle)
to be tracked. To achieve this aim, the target generation
block combines the safe zones in the potential ﬁeld with the
vehicle dynamics capability of the SV which are captured
through the reachable set of the SV from its current state.
Finally, the trajectory generation block uses an MPC to
generate feasible trajectories and steer the vehicle to the
required reference (target) states. The MPC approach in [16]
is used to solve the reference tracking problem. This MPCmethod guarantees closed-loop stability while guaranteeing
the persistent feasibility of the optimisation problem required
by any model predictive control formulation [17]. This paper
represents therefore a practical application the theoretical
problem formulation presented in [16] to autonomous ve-
hicles.
The paper is structured as follows: Section II introduces the
basic symbols and mathematical deﬁnitions used in the paper.
In Section III, the novel MPC approach in [16] is brieﬂy
overviewed to give to the reader the fundamental details of
this algorithm which has been used for trajectory planning.
In Section IV, the perception system for the vehicle using
potential ﬁeld-like functions is presented, while Section V is
dedicated to the design of the target generation block. The
design of trajectory planning based on the MPC method [16]
is covered in Section VI. The effectiveness of the framework
to support high speed overtraining is numerically shown in
Section VII. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in
Section VIII.

III. M ATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
This section provides an overview of the MPC approach
proposed in [16]. Compared to the classical MPC formula-
tion, the advantage of the control method in [16] is its ability
to steer the state of a constrained system toward any set-point
whether it belongs or not to the terminal set. The method
guarantees the asymptotic convergence of the system state to
any admissible target steady state. Furthermore, if the target
steady state is not admissible, the control strategy in [16]
steers the system to the closest admissible steady state. In
the rest of the section, details for implementing this MPC
control method are reported.
Given a discrete time LTI system with states xs2Rnx,
inputsus2Rnu, and outputs ys2Rny, a discrete time
state-space system is given by
xs(k+ 1) =Axs(k) +Bus(k) (3)

given a target steady state ^xs2Rnx, the control objective is
to ﬁnd a control action of the form u(k) =FN(xs(k);^xs)
such that the state of system (3) is steered as close as possible
to the target stare while fulﬁlling the constraints (4). Further-

IV. P ERCEPTION
In this paper, it is assumed that the vehicles are traveling on
a two-lane one-way straight road of inﬁnite length. At high-
way cruising speeds, an overtaking manoeuvre is initiated 
50 m behind the LV and ends 50 m in front of it [5]. Hence,
the SV needs to have accurate situational awareness of the
surrounding obstacles in this range to plan safe trajectories.
The authors in [20] mentioned that embedding driving rules
and collision avoidance constraints within a multi-objective
optimisation problem results in a control laws with large
computation requirements. Furthermore, potential ﬁeld-like
functions for environmental perception can be shaped in such
a way that it guides towards desired driving behaviour. In this
paper the surrounding environment is described through the
use of a potential ﬁeld where several road elements (i.e., road
limits, road markers and other road users) are considered
for shaping the potential function so as to include driving
rules and guide the SV through safe road regions. The net
potential function is generated by combining several potential
functions where the design of each function is intended to
incorporate one or more driving rule(s). The road potential
function (Uroad) is designed to keep the SV away from the
road limits, the lane potential function ( Ulane) is used for
lane-keeping, the lane velocity potential function ( Uvel) is
designed such that the SV occupies the innermost (slowest)
lane when more than one lane is available, and the car
potential function ( Ucar) is designed such that a SV either
maintains a safe distance to the LV or if the other lane is
available, moves to a faster lane. Similar to the approach
from [21], a net potential function ( Ur) is generated by
superimposing these individual potential functions to create a
perception map that can be used for autonomous overtaking
in a human-like manner. The construction of the individual
potential functions is discussed below.
A. Lane Velocity Potential
Different lanes on a road have an implicit velocity asso-
ciated with them, i.e., the velocity progressively increases
from inner (right-most) to outer (left-most) lane. Thus, if one
assumes that higher-speeds are represent high-risk, each lane
of the road can be appropriated a certain potential to describe
its risk. This is achieved by a simple gain based function as
shown below
Uvel;i(wr) =(vlane;i(wr) vlane;1(wr)) (10)
whereis a gain factor, vlane;iis the nominal velocity of
theithlane, andUvel;iis the potential due to lane-velocity
of theithlane.B. Road Potential
The road potential [21] is designed such that the bound-
aries of the road have the highest ( 1) potential and the centre
of the road has the lowest potential. A function often used
in robotics for perception is used here to describe the lane
potential and is given below
Uroad(wr) =1

whereis a scaling factor and Ybis the y-coordinate of the
bthroad edge,b2f1;2g.
C. Lane Potential
A lane potential function [21] creates a virtual barrier
between lanes to direct the SV towards the lane centre. A
Gaussian function shown below is used to achieve this desired
behaviour.

WhereYl;iis the y-coordinate of the ithlane division, and

D. Car Potential
A technique inspired by [21] is used to embed LV position,
orientation, and velocity within the potential function as an
obstacle vehicle. By modelling the LV as a rectangular area,
virtual triangular wedges, also denoted as buffer zones, are
appended to the front and rear of the LV which act as
safety buffer zones. The location ( x;ycoordinate) of triangles
vertex behind the lead-vehicle is calculated based on the
velocity of the SV and the headway time htwhile the location
of the triangles vertex in front of the lead-vehicle is calculated
based on the velocity of the LV and the headway time ht. By
denotingBlvas the set of coordinates containing the obstacle
vehicle and the two triangular wedges, a Yukawa function is
used to describe the potential due to an obstacle vehicle as
given below
Ucar(wr) =Acare Kd

whereis a Yukawa scaling factor, Acaris the Yukawa
amplitude [22], and Kdis the Euclidean distance to the

These individual potentials are superimposed to obtain an
overall perception map in the surrounding of the vehicle given
by the expression below.

assigning a threshold limit Usafe, the safe regions of the road
surrounding the SV are expressed in the inertial frame using
the set
G=
w2TR
I(wr) :Ur(wr)Usafe	
(16)
Thus, equation (16) provides a set of safe regions and the
SV needs to plan trajectories that keep it within this set
thus reducing risk. However, the set (16) does not consider
vehicle dynamics of the SV , thus some regions of the road
with satisfactory potential may not be reachable in practice.
The method designed for selecting reference points in the set
of safe regions which are compatible with the dynamics of
the SV is detailed in the next section.
V. S ELECTION OF THE TARGET POINT
The dynamics of the SV in the I-frame while driving on
a highway at a desired speed vdesare represented with a
linear kinematic bicycle model [23]. Hence, by denoting as
x= [X; Y;  ; v x]T2X R4the stack of vehicle states,
where is the heading angle, vxis the longitudinal velocity,
andX; Y are the longitudinal and lateral displacement of
the SV , respectively, the dynamics of the SV are
_x=Acx+Bcu (17)
whereu= (ax;f)2U  R2is the control action with
axandfbeing longitudinal acceleration and front steering
angle respectively. The system matrices AcandBcare given

whereLwbis the SVs wheelbase.
In ideal highway cruising situations, the dynamics of
the system can be described by _x= [vdes;0;0;0]Tand
manoeuvres (e.g., lane-change, merge, etc.) can be thought
of as transitions from one set of states to another set of
states within the set Xcc=fx2X: = 0g. In such
ideal scenarios the objective of the SV is to adjust its
trajectory to avoid obstacles while ensuring that the vehicles
speed does not exceed the desired longitudinal velocity
vdes. Starting from an initial position w0= (X0;Y0)and
traveling at vdes, using admissible control actions from the
setf(ax;f) :ax0;(ax;f)2Uvg, the setRtotal of the
states reachable without exceeding the desired velocity vdesin the time interval tof the system can be computed using
equation (2). The set of points on the road that are reachable
is a subset of which is given as
R= Projw(Rtotal) (19)
Consequently, the set of reachable lateral and longitudinal
coordinates for SV in the vehicle frame is
Rv=TI
V(R) (20)
From (16) and (19), the safe zones surrounding the SV which
are reachable with respect to the vehicle state and vehicle
dynamics is
Rsafe=G\R (21)
The, the reference target coordinates ^w=
^X;^Y
are chosen
fromRsafewith the aim to maximise the distance travelled
by the SV in the time interval t, i.e.
^w= argmax
w2Rsafejjw w0jj (22)
Furthermore, it is beneﬁcial that the SV traverses the longitu-
dinal distance from X0to^Xat uniform longitudinal velocity,
thus the target velocity ^vxis selected as
^vx=jj^X X0jj
t(23)
Furthermore, since the SV is assumed to be traveling on a
straight road, the target heading angle of the SV remains
^ = 0. Thus, stacking the reference targets for each state the
target state vector for the system ^x= [^X;^Y;^ ;^vx]Tis
obtained.
VI. T RAJECTORY GENERATION
The target states which are generated using the approach
in Section V at each time step result in piecewise references
(e.g., if a lane-change is required, ^Ywill change from
the centre of one lane to another). The MPC approach
overviewed in Section III is used in the proposed framework
to plan trajectories for directing the vehicle from its current
state to a (safe) target state in an admissible way.
As the dynamics of the state Xof system (18) depends
only onvx, it is possible to further simply the system for the
trajectory generation, thus reducing the computational time
for its generation. The reduced order system for trajectory
generation is
_xr=Arcxr+Brcu (24)
wherexr= [Y; ;v x]Tis the system state, u= [ax;f]Tis
the input, and the system matrices are

It is noted that system (24) captures the relevant dynamics
of the system and is suitable for planning safe and feasible
trajectories. Moreover, the discussions in Section V make it
evident that the reduced system is in steady-state while the
SV is driving unobstructed on straight highways as _xr(t) =
[0;0;0]T. Furthermore, the reference vector(s) calculated in
Section V corresponds to a steady-state condition for system
(24) expressed as xr;ss=h
^Y;^ ;^vxiT
.
By discretising system (24) with a sampling time Ts,
a discrete time system in the form (3) is obtained with
xs=xr;us=u. The set hard constraint Zin (4) are obtained
from the set of states and inputs satisfying the following
inequalities given below
xr;minxrxr;max (26)
uminuumax (27)
At each discrete time instant kproblem in Section III is
solved by setting the target state and the initial state as ^xs=
xr;ssandxs(0) =xr(kTs)respectively. Then the reference
trajectory [Y; ;v
x]Tfort2[kTs;(k+N)Ts], with
Nbeing the prediction horizon, is computed by applying
optimal solution uto system (18) discretised with the same
sampling time Ts.
The following algorithm summarises all the steps required
for performing a safe overtaking manoeuvre in the proposed
framework is depicted in the closed loop structure in Fig. 3.
VII. S IMULATION RESULTS
In this section, a closed-loop simulation environment is
used to evaluate the ability of the proposed framework for
planning trajectories for a high-speed overtaking manoeuvre.
The scenario is as follows: both the SV and the LV are
traveling on a two-lane one-way road of inﬁnite length
at constant longitudinal velocity vdesandvLVrespectively.
The dimensions of the road, lane-limits and LVs states are
available to the SV on-demand. The desired longitudinal
velocity of the SV vdesis provided by the route planner and

A simulation environment is initialised with the SV 130 m
behind the LV and the initialisation parameters given above.
The simulation is then allowed to run and the proposed
framework performs three primary tasks; (i) surrounding
perception, (ii) safe target identiﬁcation, and (iii) trajectory
generation at each sampling time. Some details for each task
output are given below.
Fig. 4 shows the snapshot of the perception task which is
performed during the simulation. The top ﬁgure provides a
3D-view of the entire potential function and the local minima
at the centre of each lane for guiding a SV can be seen along
with the trapezoidal ﬁeld created by a LV (it is noted that
in Fig. 4 large value of the potential ﬁeld are truncated for
the sake of readability of the ﬁgure). The bottom plot depicts
the level curves for the same time instant in the road-frame.
The LV is depicted as red rectangle and the buffer zones
(as triangular appendages) where the potential ﬁeld rapidly
increases to prevent the SV from getting too close to the LV
during the different phases of an overtaking manoeuvre can
be easily observed. The reachable set of the SV for vdes=
33:33 m s 1and admissible steering inputs is shown in the V-
frame in Fig. 5. It is noted that as the precise computation of
Rvaccording to (2) is not trivial, in the simulation a convex
approximation of this set is exploited and the MPT3 toolbox
[24] in M ATLAB has been used for its computation.
As the region Blv(unsafe region) surrounding the LV
moves in the road-frame with speed vLV vx, at each time
step the perception of the safe reachable region in (21) and
the reference targets in (22) change accordingly. The resulting
reference targets for some time steps are depicted in Fig. 6 in
the inertial-frame together with the position of the subject and
LV . Fig. 6 clear shows the target references selected by the
SV for safely overtaking. For t<15 s the SV moves behind
the LV , for t2[15;30] s the centre of the fast lane has a1066

lower potential and it is compatible with the SV dynamics,
thus allowing the SV to move to this lane to overtake the
LV . Finally for t > 30 s the centre of the slow lane once
again has the lowest potential and is also reachable for the
SV . Thus, the SV can merge back in the slow lane at a safe
distance in front of the LV thus completing the overtaking
manoeuvre.
The reference points dynamically generated are used di-
rectly for generating trajectories. The ability of the approach
discussed in Section VI to generate feasible trajectories for
performing manoeuvres can be observed in Fig. 7 where the
planned trajectories and the actual path of the SV are shown
in the LVs reference frame (i.e. vehicle-frame). This ﬁgure
demonstrates that the overtaking manoeuvre is initiated about
50 m behind the LV and terminates at a distance over 50 m in
front of the LV thus maintaining the margins expected from
a typical highway manoeuvre. These margins are based on
the speeds of the two vehicles and the headway time ht.
Furthermore, the planned trajectories from the MPC con-
troller are stable and do not demonstrate diverging behaviour.
By assuming perfect trajectory tracking, the actual trajectory
followed by the SV is shown to follow a smooth path from
the centre of the slow (right) lane to the fast (left) lane
further bolstering the ability of the proposed framework at
generating feasible trajectories for performing manoeuvres
in structured driving environments. It is noted that in the
proposed approach the parameters of the MPC strategy (i.e.,
Q;R;P;T , andN) can be tuned for adjusting the aggressive-

by this novel MPC are persistently feasible thus providing an
additional safety-net to the autonomous driving functionality.
Finally, the trajectories of the subject and LV are shown
two vehicles and the relevant states and inputs of the SV
are shown in in the inertial frame in Fig. 8. The top plot
shows the actual path followed by the two vehicles and
the trajectory of the overtaking manoeuvre for the SV can
be observed. Furthermore, since the SV is travelling with a
higher longitudinal velocity it covers a larger portion of the
road segment in the given time. The response of the MPC
controller while; (i) increasing the longitudinal velocity of the
SV , (ii) providing steering action for performing the lateral
motions, (iii) providing smooth inputs, and (iv) respecting the
system constraints can be observed in the remaining plots of

VIII. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, a mathematical framework for trajectory
planning for an autonomous high-speed driving was pre-
sented. The components of this proposed framework were;
(i) artiﬁcial potential ﬁelds were used to map the surrounding
region of an autonomous vehicle, (ii) target generation block
to identify safe target regions surrounding the SV based
on a reachability analysis, and (iii) an asymptotically stable
MPC based controller to plan feasible trajectories for the
SV to direct it along the safe regions of the road. Thus,
in this framework the onus of collision avoidance lies with
the perception sub-system and the onus of feasible trajectory1067

lies with the MPC controller. This modular design allows
the framework to avoid non-convex constraints allowing for
an MPC formulation that can be converted to an explicit
control law using common multi-parametric programming
tools. Numerical results demonstrated that the algorithm is
able to respect the safety considerations for high speed
overtaking manoeuvre and generate trajectories which are
also compatible with the vehicle dynamics and safety con-
siderations.
Future work includes enhancing the MPC controller to
generate feasible trajectories over a larger longitudinal ve-
locity range by making it robust against non-linear lateral
dynamics. Finally, the framework will be extend to consider
multiple moving obstacles within the perception and target
generation components.
