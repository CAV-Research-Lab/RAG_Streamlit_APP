Abstract — Automated vehicles are increasingly getting
main-streamed and this has pushed development of systemsfor autonomous manoeuvring (e.g., lane-change, merge, andovertake) to the forefront. A novel framework for situationalawareness and trajectory planning to perform autonomousovertaking in high-speed structured environments (e.g., highwayand motorway) is presented in this paper. A combination of apotential ﬁeld like function and reachability sets of a vehicle areused to identify safe zones on a r oad that the vehicle can navigate
towards. These safe zones are provided to a tube-based robust
model predictive controller as reference to generate feasible
trajectories for combined lateral and longitudinal motion of avehicle. The strengths of the proposed framework are: 1) it is freefrom non-convex collision avoidance constraints; 2) it ensuresfeasibility of trajectory even if decelerating or accelerating whileperforming lateral motion; and 3) it is real-time implementable.The ability of the proposed framework to plan feasible trajec-tories for high-speed overtaking is validated in a high-ﬁdelityIPG CarMaker and Simulink co-simulation environment.

I. I NTRODUCTION
THE initial waves of autonomous driving cars are plying
on public roads and successfully providing features such
as lane-keeping, distance maintenance, lane departure, cruis-ing, etc. Such systems have helped in improving safety on
highways, occupant comfort while reducing driver workload
simultaneously [1]. However, human intervention or input is
still required while performing more challenging, but equally
common manoeuvres (e.g., lane-change, merge, overtake etc.).

Digital Object Identiﬁer 10.1109/TITS.2019.2916354Fig. 1. Schematic of an overtaking ma noeuvre (SV: subject vehicle, LV: lead
vehicle).
Overtaking represents a template for such complex manoeu-
vres as it ( i) combines lateral and longitudinal motion of an
overtaking vehicle (subject vehicle) while avoiding collisions
with a slower moving obstacle vehicle (lead vehicle), and
(ii) includes sub-manoeuvres i.e., lane-change, lane-keeping,
and another lane change back to the original lane in a
sequential manner [2] (see Fig. 1). Hence, the development of
autonomous overtaking systems is under great focus since itunlocks the potential to perform a host of different manoeuvres
and pushes the cap abilities of aut onomous vehicle further
towards the overall goal of complete end-to-end autonomy.
The inherently intricate structure of overtaking stems from
its dependence on a large number of factors such as roadcondition, weather, trafﬁc condition, type of overtaking vehi-
cle, type of overtaken vehicle, relative velocity, legislation,
culture, etc. [3]. Furthermore, each overtaking manoeuvre isunique in terms of duration of the manoeuvre, relative velocity
between vehicles, distance travelled, etc. [4]–[8] thus making
classiﬁcation and standardisation difﬁcult. Moreover, safely
performing an overtaking manoe uvre requires accurate infor-
mation of road and lane availability, lead vehicle trajectory,lead vehicle driving intentions, road conditions, etc.
There are a variety of diverse ways proposed in literature for
planning safe trajectories to perform an autonomous overtak-ing manoeuvre by treating it as a moving-obstacle avoidance
problem. Incremental search based algorithms and sampling
based trajectory planning methods such as ‘Rapidly exploring
Random Trees’ (RRT) have been proposed for planning safe
trajectories for autonomous overtaking [9]–[13]. Even thoughalgorithms incorporating basic vehicle kinematics within a
RRT search algorithm have been proposed, the planned trajec-
tories can be jerky which could lead to reduced occupant com-fort. If accurate knowledge of road and surrounding obstacles

is available, potential ﬁeld based techniques are shown to be
successful at generating collision free trajectories for avoiding
stationary or moving obstacles [9], [14]. However, while guar-
anteeing collision free trajectories, potential ﬁeld based meth-ods do not incorporate vehicle dynamics and hence cannot
ensure feasibility of the planned trajectory [15]–[17]. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) helps address these shortcomingswith its ability to formulate veh icle dynamics and collision
avoidance constraints as a ﬁnite-horizon constrained optimi-
sation problem. However, collision avoidance constraints for
trajectory planning are generally non-convex which limits the
feasibility and uniqueness of the solution of the optimisa-tion problem. Researchers rely on techniques such as con-
vexiﬁcation [18], change of reference frame [19]–[21], create
approximate linear collision avoidance constraints [22], [23],and shared control [24], [25] to address the issue. In [26]
the concept of motion primitives is included within an MPC
framework to plan collision avoidance trajectories. However,
since these motion primitives were computed ofﬂine and
accessed via a look-up table, only a subset of all feasibletrajectories were considered for motion planning. In [2] over-
taking trajectories were gener ated by directing the vehicle
along virtual target points located at safe distances aroundthe lead vehicle thus reformulating trajectory planning into a
navigation problem. A similar approach inspired from missile
guidance systems called Rendezvous Guidance was used to
plan a trajectory for an overtaking manoeuvre [27], [28]. How-
ever, in all these techniques the subject vehicle (SV) has beenmodelled as a point mass with no dynamics and hence these
methods are unsuitable for high-speed trajectory planning of
autonomous vehicles. For the brevity of the paper, interestedreaders are directed towards [29] for more details related to
trajectory planning for autonomous overtaking.
In this paper, extracting the relevant beneﬁts of each
approach described in the literature, we propose a mathe-
matical framework of potential ﬁeld like functions and MPCfor performing an autonomous high-speed overtaking manoeu-
vre. The framework is composed by three components ( i)
an artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld, ( ii) a target generation block,
and ( iii) a trajectory generatio n block. This paper is an
extension of our previous work in [30] and builds upon the
framework by ( i) using a tube-based robust MPC technique
to plan feasible trajectories over a larger range of vehicle
velocities, ( ii) development of collision avoidance constraints
based on lateral position and velocity of the subject vehicle,
and ( iii) numerically validating the entire framework in IPG
CarMaker-Simulink co-simulation environment. The potentialﬁeld is used to map the surrounding region of the subject
vehicle. Contrary to typical pot ential ﬁeld approaches where an
obstacle’s position has been used to identify high-risk zones,the method in this paper combines an obstacle’s position,
orientation and relative velocity to create a map of safe
zones surrounding the subject vehicle. At every sampling
instant, the target generation b lock identiﬁes the safest point
of the road which is compatible with the dynamics of thesubject vehicle and computes the r eference state set point (e.g.,
velocity, lateral position, an d heading angle) to be tracked.
To achieve this aim of reaching t he reference, the targetgeneration block combines the safe zones in the potential ﬁeld
with the vehicle dynamics capability of the subject vehicle
which are captured through the reachable set of the subject
vehicle from its current state. Fi nally, the trajectory generation
block uses a MPC strategy to generate feasible trajectories
and steer the vehicle to the requi red reference (target) states.
The robust tube based MPC approach in [31] and [32] isused to solve the reference tracking problem. The dynamics
of the lateral and yaw motio n of a vehicle have a nonlinear
relation with the longitudinal velocity. The robust tube based
MPC formulation allows this nonlinearity to be modelled as
an additive disturbance which allows the controller to planfeasible lateral motion (lane-change) trajectories over a large
range of longitudinal velocities. Moreover, the robust MPC
method proposed in [31] and [32] guarantees ( i) closed-loop
stability, and ( ii) persistent feasibility of the optimisation
problem which is desirable for any model predictive control
formulation [33]. Additionally, a novel technique of designing
collision avoidance constraints a s a function of the longitudinal
velocity and lateral position of the vehicle is presented. Thistechnique differs from the ones in literature since the constraint
design does not depend on the longitudinal position thus
allowing the designers the possibility of reducing the statedimension of the system. This i s beneﬁcial as removing a state
from the system model helps in reducing the dimension of the
parameters space which helps in bringing down the memory
and computational requirements for solving the optimisationproblem. Hence, this paper represents practical use of thetheory on the robust MPC presented in [31] and [32] to design
admissible, safe, and collision free trajectories for autonomous
vehicles. The effectiveness of the entire framework for highspeed autonomous overtaking is validated in a co-simulation
platform where high-ﬁdelity ve hicle dynamics are simulated
in IPG-CarMaker while the trajectory planning method with
the MPC is implemented in M
ATLAB /Simulink.
The paper is structured as follo ws: Section II introduces the
basic symbols and mathematical deﬁnitions used in the paper.
The mathematical formulation of relevant vehicle dynamics
and vehicle model structure to be used for controller designis discussed in Section III. In Section IV, the robust MPC
approach in [31] and [32] is brieﬂy overviewed to give to
the reader the fundamental details of this algorithm which has
been used for trajectory planning. In Section V, the situation
awareness system for the vehicle using potential ﬁeld likefunctions is presented, while Section VI is dedicated to the
design of the target generation block. The design of trajectory
planning based on the MPC method in [31] and [32] along withthe design of the collision avoidance constraints is covered in
Section VII. The effectiveness of the framework to support
high speed overtaking is numerically shown in Section VIII.Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Section IX.

For solving the overtaking problem through the combined
use of MPC and potential ﬁeld, in addition to a coordinate
inertial-frame (I-frame), three a dditional coordinate frames
are exploited, i.e., vehicle-frame (V-Frame), obstacle-frame(O-frame), and road-frame (R-frame). The V-frame is located
in the centre of gravity of the subject vehicle and follows
the Roll-Pitch-Yaw (RPY) convention [35]. Similarly, the
O-frame is located at the centre of gravity of the lead vehicle
and follows the RPY convention while the R-frame is amoving coordinate frame located at the projection of the origin
of V-frame onto the innermost (rightmost) edge of the road
with x-axis in the direction of the travel. A generic point onthe road is denoted as p=(ξ,η),p
r=(ξr,ηr),pv=(ξv,ηv),
orpo=(ξo,ηo)when expressed in the inertial, road, vehicle,
or obstacle frame, respectively. The coordinate frames are
depicted in Fig. 2 where wlane[m] is the width of the lane
while shadow area denotes a rectangle moving along theroad-frame with vertices V={V

awareness and thus the values of {V1,V2,V3,V4}are chosen
in a range relevant for high-speed overtaking [5], [29], [36].

III. C ONTROL ORIENTED VEHICLE MODEL
A wide variety of vehicle models have been developed by
researchers to study the dynamics of a vehicle and controller
design for various applications [37]. A comprehensive surveyof vehicle model for trajectory planning in [15] list out the
relevant vehicle models for this task. Moreover, the review
paper for trajectory planning for autonomous high speedovertaking demonstrates that co mpared to point mass vehicle
models, single track vehicle models (i.e., bicycle models)
provide a suitable compromise between model order and
model accuracy [29]. A nonlinear kinematic vehicle model
assumes no slip between tyre and road is found to be suitablefor trajectory planning for hi ghway driving when lateral accel-
eration is within bounds ( |a
y|≤0.4g) [38], [39] (see Fig. 3).
Furthermore, since normal driving on the highway involvessmall steering inputs, small angles approximation for the
side-slip angle and steering angle are often assumed [40], [41].
Under this assumption of small angles approximation thevehicle bicycle model is :

˙η=vψ+l
r
lf+lrvδf (3b)
˙ψ=1
lf+lrvδf (3c)
˙v=ax (3d)
where ξandηare the longitudinal and lateral displacement of
the centre of gravity in the I-frame, ψis the inertial heading
angle, vis the velocity of the vehicle, lfis the distance of
front axle from centre of gravity, and lris the distance of the
rear axle from the centre of gravity. The control inputs arelongitudinal acceleration a
xand front steering angle δf.T h e
two aspects that stand-out based on the system dynamics in (3)
are: ( i) nonlinearity in the system, and ( ii) close dependence
of longitudinal velocity on the lateral and yaw dynamics of
the vehicle. To simplify the design of path planning, systemin (3) might be linearised around a nominal longitudinal speed.
However, the resulting lateral and yaw predictions of such
linear system are valid only when the longitudinal speed

does not deviate with respect to the nominal one. Hence,
as a vehicle is expected to acceler ate (and possibly decelerate)
while performing the lane change and passing sub-manoeuvres
of the overtaking manoeuvre, linearising this system around anominal velocity might lead to inaccuracies in lateral and yaw
predictions leading to unfeasible and/or unsafe trajectory gen-
eration. To tackle nonlinear vehicle dynamics systematically,authors have proposed ( i) maintain constant vehicle longitudi-
nal velocity during the lane change [2], ( ii) design non-linear
controllers [2], and ( iii) successive linearisation [42]. In this
paper, model (3) is used for computing the reachability sets
of a vehicle to identify safe driving zones, while for thegeneration of the vehicle trajectory toward a target point,
model (3) is rewritten as a linear time invariant (LTI) system
subjected to an additive bounded disturbance. This is achievedby denoting x

and u/defines[ax,δf]T∈U⊆R2the system input with Xaand

system shown below.
xa(k+1)=Ad(v)xa(k)+Bd(v)u(k) (6)
The pair (Ad(v), Bd(v))is the discretised version of the pair
(Ac(v), Bc(v)). For a given parameter (here v∈Projv(Xa)),
(Ad(v), Bd(v))can take values from the convex set Pdeﬁned
as
P=co{/parenleftbigAd,j(v), Bd,j(v)/parenrightbig|j∈J} (7)
withJ∈{1,2,···,J}, see [43] (chapter 3). Accordingly the
dynamics of the LPV system (6) can be rewritten as a nominal
LTI system subjected to an additive disturbance, i.e.,
xa(k+1)=Admxa(k)+Bdmu(k)+wa (8)
where the pair (Adm,Bdm)is obtained by the expression
below [43].

Moreover, the disturbance wais deﬁned as
wa=(Ad(v)−Adm)xa(k)+(Bd(v)−Bdm)u(k) (10)
and thus is bound by the set Wdeﬁned as
W={(Ad(v)−Adm)xa(k)+(Bd(v)−Bdm)u(k)|
(Ad(v), Bd(v))∈P,(xa,u)∈Xa×U} (11)
It is noted that the structure of model (8) enables the use
the robust tube-based MPC which is brieﬂy revised in the
following section.IV . C ONTROL FORMULATION
This section provides an overview of the robust MPC
approach proposed in [31] and [32]. Compared to the classical
MPC formulation [33], the advantage of the control method
in [31] and [32] is its ability to steer the state of a constrained
system toward any set-point (i.e. desired target steady state)
whether it belongs to the terminal set or not. The methodguarantees the asymptotic convergence of the system state
to any admissible target steady state. Furthermore, if the
target steady state is not admissible, the control strategyin [31] and [32] steers the system to the closest admissible
steady state. Moreover, the optimisation problem to solve
at each sampling time is a quadratic programming problem,
which allows explicit implementation of the method, thus
facilitating its deployment in real time. Given a discrete lineartime-invariant system with states x∈X⊆R
nx, inputs
u∈U⊆Rnu, outputs y∈Y⊆Rny, and bounded process
disturbance w∈W⊆Rnx,w h e r e X,UandWare known
bounded convex sets, a discrete time state-space system is
given by
x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k)+w (12a)
y(k)=Cx(k)+Du(k) (12b)
where the matrices A,B,C,and Dare constant and it is
assumed that the pair (A,B)is controllable. The control objec-
tive is to stabilize system (12) and steer it in the neighbourhood
of a reference set-point despite the disturbance while keeping
the system state and control input within the required set
constraints (i.e., XandU, respectively) The solution proposed
in [31] and [32] leverages a nominal system of the plant in
(12) deﬁned as
¯x(k+1)=A¯x(k)+B¯u(k) (13a)
¯y(k)=C¯x(k)+D¯u(k) (13b)
where ¯x,¯u,a n d ¯yare the state, input and output of the
nominal model, respectively. The idea in [31] and [32] to
solve the constrained control problem for the uncertain system(12) is to use an MPC approach to steer the nominal model
(13) towards the desired set point but with modiﬁed state and
input set constraints, denoted as ¯X,a n d ¯U, respectively. The
set constrains for the nominal model are selected such that
if the closed-loop solution of the nominal system satisﬁes
(¯x(k),¯u(k))∈¯X×¯U,∀k,t h e n (x(k),u(k))∈X×U.T h e s e
tightened set constraints for the nominal system are computed
as
¯X=X/circleminusZ,¯U=U/circleminusKZ (14)
where K∈R

AKe(k)+w, with e/defines(x−¯x), such that
AKZ⊕W⊆Z (15)
In [31] and [32] it was proven that if ¯Xand¯Uare non-empty
sets they contain the steady state set-points and control inputsthat can be robustly imposed to system (12) when e(0)=
x(0)−¯x(0)∈Z, under the control action
u=¯u+Ke,¯u∈¯U (16)

It is noted that, given a target steady state ˆx∈Rnx, the control
action ¯uis generated by using a receding horizon technique
to steer system (13) to an admissible steady-state ρss=
(¯xss,¯uss)∈¯X×¯U, such that ¯xssis as close as possible to ˆx.
Moreover, the subspace of steady-states and inputs of system
(13) have a linear representation of the form
ρss=Mθθ (17)
where θ∈Rnθis a parameter vector th at characterises the sub-
space of steady-states and inputs and Mθis a matrix of suitable
dimensions (see [31], [32] for further details). Furthermore,

•The terms of the cost function under the summation
represent the penalty for deviating from the steady-state

•As the optimisation problem (18) can be expressed as aquadratic programming problem, it can be converted to
an explicit MPC form to reduce online computations [45]
•System constraint handling capabilities and closed loop
asymptotic stability and feas ibility of the p roposed con-
troller are proven in [31]
•The minimal robust invariant set Zcan be computed
using the recursive algorithm proposed in [44].
V. L OCAL RISKMAP
In this paper, it is assumed that the vehicles (subject vehicles
and other trafﬁc vehicles) are travelling on a one-way straightroad of inﬁnite length. At highway speeds, in addition to
maintaining approximately a lane-width’s distance with each
vehicle in the lateral direction, vehicles also maintain safetydistances of ≈50 m to the vehicle in front and behind [5].
Therefore, an overtaking manoeuvre is expected to maintain
these distances while performing the lane-change manoeuvres
that mark the start and end of an overtaking manoeuvre
resulting in the need for a subject vehicle to have accuratesituational awareness of the surrounding obstacles in this range
to plan safe trajectories. Semsar-Kazerooni et al. [46], [47]
mentioned that embedding driving rules and collision avoid-ance constraints within a multi-objective optimisation problem
results in a control laws with large computation requirements.
On the other hand, a potential ﬁeld like function for envi-
ronmental risk detection can be shaped in such a way that
it guides towards desired driving behaviour. In this paper thesurrounding environment is described through the use of a
potential ﬁeld where several road elements (i.e., road limits,
road markers, and other road users) are considered for shapingthe potential function so as to include driving rules and guide
the subject vehicle through safe road regions. The net potential
function is generated by combin ing several potential functions
where the design of each function is intended to incorporate
one or more driving rule(s). The road potential function (U
road)
is designed to keep the subject vehicle away from the roadlimits, the lane potential function (U
lane)is used for lane-
keeping, the lane velocity potential function (Uvel)is designed
such that the subject vehicle occupies the innermost (slowest)
lane when more than one lane is available, and the car potential
function (Ucar)is designed such that a subject vehicle either
DIXIT et al. : TRAJECTORY PLANNING FOR AUTONOMOUS HIGH-SPEED OVERTAKING IN STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS 2315
maintains a safe distance to the lead vehicle or if the other lane
is available, moves to a faster lane. Similar to the approach
presented in [48], a net potential function (Ur)is generated
by superimposing these individual potential functions to createlocal risk maps that can be used for autonomous overtaking
in a human-like manner. The construction of the individual
potential functions is discussed below.
A. Lane Velocity Potential
Different lanes on a road have an implicit velocity asso-
ciated with them, i.e., the vel ocity progressively increases
from inner (right-most) to outer (left-most) lane. Thus, if one
assumes that higher-speeds rep resent higher-risk, each lane of
the road can be appropriated a certain potential to describeits risk. This is achieved by a simple gain-based function as
shown below.
U
vel,i(pr)=γ/bracketleftbig
vlane,i(pr)−vlane,1(pr)/bracketrightbig
(24)
where γis a gain factor, vlane,iis the nominal velocity of the
ithlane, and Uvel,iis the potential due to lane-velocity of the
ithlane.
B. Road Potential
The road potential [48] is designed such that the boundaries
of the road have the highest (∞)potential and the centre of the
road has the lowest potential. A function often used in robotics
for perception is used here to d escribe the road potential and
is given below.
Uroad(pr)=1

b=1/parenleftbigg1
ηr−ηr,b/parenrightbigg2
(25)
where ζis a scaling factor and ηr,bis the y-coordinate of the
bthroad edge, b∈{1,2}.
C. Lane Potential
A lane potential function [48] creates a virtual barrier
between lanes to direct the subject vehicle towards the lane
centre. A Gaussian function shown below is used to achievethis desired behaviour.
U

2σ2/parenrightBigg
(26)
Where ηl,iis the y-coordinate of the ithlane division, σand
Alane are scaling factors, and Ulane,iis the potential due to
lane boundary of the ithlane.
D. Car Potential
A technique inspired by [48] is used to embed lead vehicle
position, orientation, and velocity within the potential function
as an obstacle vehicle. By modelling the lead vehicle as
a rectangular area, virtual triangular wedges, also denoted
as buffer zones, are appended to the front and rear of thelead vehicle which act as safety margins. The location ( x,y
coordinate) of triangle’s vertex behind the lead-vehicle is
calculated based on the velocity of the subject vehicle andthe headway time h
twhile the location of the triangle’s vertex
in front of the lead-vehicle is calculated based on the velocity
of the lead vehicle and the headway time ht. By denoting /Gamma1lv
as the set of coordinates in the R-frame containing the obstacle
vehicle and the two triangular wedges, a Yukawa function is
used to describe the potential due to an obstacle vehicle as
given below.
Ucar(pr)=Acar/parenleftbigge−αKd
Kd/parenrightbigg
(27)
where αis a Yukawa scaling factor, Acaris the Yukawa
amplitude [49], and Kdis the Euclidean distance to the nearest
coordinate of the obstacle given as
Kd=min
b0∈/Gamma1lv||b0−pr|| (28)
where b0represents the set of points lying within the obstacle.
These individual potentials are superimposed to obtain an
overall risk map in the surrounding of the vehicle given by
the expression below.
Ur(pr)=Uvel+Uroad+Ulane+Ucar (29)
Where Ulane=Nlanes/summationtext
i=1Ulane,iand Uvel=Nlanes/summationtext
i=1Uvel,iwith Nlanes
being the number of lanes. To facilitate trajectory planning the
potential ﬁeld is studied in the inertial frame through the use
of the function U(p)/Delta1=Ur/parenleftbig
TI
R(p)/parenrightbig
. By assigning a threshold
limit Usafe, the safe regions of the road surrounding the subject
vehicle are expressed in the inertial frame using the set
G={p∈TI
R(/Gamma1lv):U(p)≤Usafe} (30)
Thus, equation (30) provides a set of safe regions and the
subject vehicle needs to plan trajectories that keep it within
this region set thereby reducing risk. Moreover, since the netpotential ﬁeld depends on the states of the subject vehicle (lon-
gitudinal position, lateral position, and longitudinal velocity)
and the lead vehicle (longitudinal position, lateral position, and
longitudinal velocity), it updates at each time instant to provide
an accurate environmental repre sentation for a subject vehicle.
However, the set (30) does not consider vehicle dynamics
of the subject vehicle, thus some regions of the road with
satisfactory potential may not be reachable in practice. The
method designed for selecting reference points in the set of
safe regions which are compatible with the dynamics of the
subject vehicle is detailed in the next section.
VI. S
ELECTION OF THE TARGET POINT
In this section, the method designed for selecting reference
points in the set of safe regions which are compatible with
the dynamics of the subject vehicle is detailed. In idealhighway cruising conditions, a vehicle is expected to traverse
along at a constant desired longitudinal velocity v
deswhile
maintaining its lane position. While travelling on a straight
road, these dynamics of the system from (3) can be described
by˙xa=[vdes,0,0,0]T. However, in real world scenarios,
a vehicle is unable to maintain constant longitudinal velocity
and lane position (due to trafﬁc, route, etc.) and has to
perform different manoeuvres such as lane-change, merge, etc.
2316 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYS TEMS, VOL. 21, NO. 6, JUNE 2020
These manoeuvres can be thought of as transitions from one
set of states to another set of states within the set Xac={x∈
Xa:ψ=0}. In such ideal scenarios the objective of the
subject vehicle is to adjust its trajectory to avoid obstacles
while ensuring that the vehicle’s speed is maintained within
the range v∈Projv(Xa). Starting from an initial position
p0=(ξ0,η0)and travelling at vdes, using admissible control
actions from the set {(ax,δf):ax≤0,(ax,δf)∈U},t h es e t
Rtotal⊂R4of the vehicle conﬁgurations (states) reachable
without exceeding the desired velocity vdesin the time interval
[0,t∗]of the system can be computed using (2) and the vehicle
model (3). The set of points on the road that are reachableR⊂R
2form a subset of Rtotaland is expressed as
R=Projp(Rtotal) (31)
Remarks:
•The velocity vdescorresponds to the maximum velocity
of the SV as desired by the occupants and it is upperbound by the legal speed-limit of the road.
•Thus, from a given initial position p0, the subject vehicle
can theoretically reach all points lying within the set R
without exceeding the maximum desired velocity vdes.
It is noteworthy that the set of admissible control actionsmentioned above is a subset of Ua n di su s e do n l y
for computing the reachable se t, the trajectory planning
algorithm will have the entire set Uat its disposal for
generating feasible trajectories.
From (30), (31) the safe zones surrounding the subject vehicle
which are reachable with respect to the current vehicle state
and vehicle dynamics is
R
safe/definesG∩R (32)
Then, the reference target coordinates ˆp=(ˆξ,ˆη)are chosen
fromRwith the aim to maximise the distance travelled by
the subject vehicle in the time interval [0,t∗],i . e .
ˆp=arg max
p∈Rsafe||p−p0|| (33)
The longitudinal distance from ξ0toˆξcan be traversed by
the SV by travelling with a uniform longitudinal velocity
calculated using the equation below.
ˆv=||ˆξ−ξ0||
t∗(34)
A vehicle with the ability to closely match or follow the
reference velocity computed above will enhance its ability
of get closer to the reference position ˆp. Thus, if the initial
velocity v0of the vehicle is not equal to the target velocity ˆv,
the trajectory planner should come up with a suitable accel-
eration proﬁle to accelerate/d ecelerate the vehicle to achieve
the target velocity ˆv. Moreover, since the subject vehicle is
assumed to be travelling on a straight road, the target heading
angle of the subject vehicle remains
ˆψ=0 (35)
It is noteworthy that in case the subject vehicle is travelling on
a curved road, target heading angle ˆψcan be obtained fromthe road orientation at the given coordinate (ˆξ,ˆη)stored in the
vehicle’s mapping functionality. Thus, stacking the reference
targets for each state the target state vector ˆxa=[ˆξ,ˆη,ˆψ,ˆv]T
for the system is obtained. It is noted that, the set of reachable
lateral and longitudinal coordinates for subject vehicle in the
vehicle frame is
RV=TI
V(R) (36)
VII. T RAJECTORY GENERATION
The target states ˆxawhich are generated using the approach
in the Section VI at each time step result in piecewise
references (e.g., if a lane-change is required, ˆηwill change
from the centre of one lane to another). The robust MPC
approach overviewed in Section IV is used in the proposed
framework to plan trajectories for directing the vehicle fromits current state x
a(0)=[ξ0,η0,ψ0,v0]Tto a (safe) target state
ˆxa=[ˆξ,ˆη,ˆψ,ˆv]Tin an admissible way (i.e. by considering
vehicle dynamics, state constraints, and input constraints).
As the dynamics of the state ξof system (4) depends only on
v, it is possible to further simplify the system for the trajectory
generation. The reduced order system for trajectory generation
is
x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k)+w, y(k)=x(k) (37)
where x=[η,ψ,v ]Tis the system state, u=[ ax,δf]T
is the input, wis the disturbance vector composed by the
last three entries of the wa-term in (10), and the system
and input matrices Aand Bare obtained by extracting the
appropriate rows and columns of Admand Bdmin (8), respec-
tively. The state and input constraints polyhedrons XandU
are
X={x∈R3:xmin≤x≤xmax} (38a)
U={u∈R2:umin≤u≤umax} (38b)
where xmin,xmax∈R3and umin,umax∈R2are constant
vectors. It is noted that the boundedness of XandUand
the structure wa-term in (10) imply that the w-term in (8)
belongs to a bounded polyhedron set denoted as W[43].
From (37) and (38), it follows that the vehicle dynamics of
interest for the overtaking manoeuvre match the hypothesisrequired for the application of the robust MPC in Section IV,
which is therefore used for the generation of a feasible path to
steer the vehicle toward ˆx=[ˆη,ˆψ,ˆv]
Tbelonging to the safe
reacheble set (32), where ˆη,ˆψandˆvare deﬁned in the section
above.
A. Collision Avoidance Constraints
The basic tools that are used to construct the potential ﬁeld
for situational awarness can also be used to obtain collision
avoidance constraints that can be added to the optimisation
problem in (18). An example demonstrating how the collision
avoidance constraints can be designed while approaching alead vehicle is explained using Fig. 4 as an exemplar. While
designing the potential ﬁeld in Section V-D, the equation
a
caξ+bcaη+cca=0 is one of the hyperplanes that is
DIXIT et al. : TRAJECTORY PLANNING FOR AUTONOMOUS HIGH-SPEED OVERTAKING IN STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENTS 2317

SV - blue rectangle, LV and surrounding unsafe region - red polygon, targetcoordinate - magenta cross, safe zone - green polygon.
used to construct the bounds of the unsafe region around the
lead vehicle ( /Gamma1lv). However, the utility of this hyperplane is
expanded by using it to divide the given road segment into twozones; ( i) safe zone represented by a
caξ+bcaη+cca>0,
and ( ii) unsafe zone represented by acaξ+bcaη+cca<0, see
Fig. 4.
Thus, for a subject vehicle located at (ξ0,η0),a nM P Cb a s e d
trajectory planner can ensure collision-free motion if con-straints are designed that limits all planned trajectories to stay
within the safe zone. This is the crux of the various collision
avoidance constraints that are described in literature [19], [50].However, as discussed in the section above, in this paper a
reduced order system that does not have longitudinal position
ξas one of its states is used by the MPC for planning trajec-
tories. This gives rise to the need of expressing the collision
avoidance constraints using the states from the reduced ordersystem i.e., ηandv.
1) Constraint I: If(ξ
0,η0)represent the current location of
the SV in global coordinates and in the context of MPC areknown values then the satisfaction of the following constraint
equation guarantees that initially the subject vehicle is within
the safe zone.
a
caξ0+bcaη0+cca>0 (39)
2) Constraint II: Similarly for a given nominal initial state
¯x(0)=(¯η,¯ψ,¯v), which is a part of the decision variable of the
problem in (18), the equation below ensures that the nominalinitial position of the SV is also within the safe zone.
a
caξ0+bca¯η+cca>0 (40)
3) Constraint III: Finally, it is important to ensure that
the trajectory obtained by solving the optimisation problemin (18) guarantees that the SV stays within the safe zone
throughout the prediction horizon. From (3a), (4) it is evident
that the evolution of the longitudinal position ξis a function
of the longitudinal velocity of a vehicle v. Thus, along a
given prediction horizon N, the predicted nominal longitudinal
position ¯ξcan be estimated using the initial longitudinal
position ξ
0and the predicted nominal velocity ¯vusing the
equation below.
¯ξ(j)=⎡
⎣ξ0+j/summationdisplay
i=1(¯v(i)·ts)⎤
⎦;j=1,2,..., N (41)
The expression above is utilized to create Ndifferent con-
straints that fulﬁll the collision avoidance criterion along the
entire prediction horizon. The generalized constraint equation
that is used to create the Ndifferent constraint equations isFig. 5. Closed-loop framewo rk for trajectory planning. Note: LV denotes

aca⎡
⎣ξ0+j/summationdisplay

⎦+bca¯η(j)+cca>0;
j=1,2,..., N (42)
where the predicted nominal velocity ¯v(i)and predicted lateral
position ¯η(i)can be obtained from the prediction model
in (19). Therefore, the set of (N+2)equations obtained
from (39), (40) and from different values of jin (42)
represent collision avoidance constraints that are expressedsolely as a function of two states namely lateral position
and longitudinal velocity. These inequalities representing the
collision avoidance constraints can be supplemented to the
constraints of the optimisation problem in (18) to ensure
that the planned trajectory is collision free along the entireprediction horizon. It is noteworthy that the technique for
design of the collision avoidance constraints described above
can be easily adopted to situations where ( i) the SV needs
to perform the lane-change while completing an overtaking
manoeuvre and/or ( ii) when there are multiple hyperplanes
representing collision-avoidance constraints for more than one
trafﬁc member.
At each discrete time instant k, problem in (18) with
additional constraints (39), (40), and (42) is solved by set-
ting the target state and the initial state as ˆx=[ ˆη,ˆψ,ˆv]
T
and xp=x(k)respectively. The optimal trajectory x∗=
[ξ∗,η∗,ψ∗,v∗]Tis generated by simulating the vehicle
model (3) with the optimal inputs u∗=[a∗
x,δ∗
f]Tfrom the
solution of MPC problem (18) and then passed to a trajectory
tracking controller as reference signals. The following algo-
rithm (depicted in the closed loop structure in Fig. 5) sum-marises all the steps required for performing a safe overtaking
manoeuvre in the proposed framework, see Algorithm 1.

UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, a results obtained from a closed-loop simu-
lations are used to evaluate the ability of the proposed frame-
work for planning trajectories for a high-speed overtaking
manoeuvre. The scenario used is as follows: both the subject
vehicle and the lead vehicle are travelling on a two-lane one-way road of inﬁnite length at longitudinal velocity vand
v
LV, respectively. The dimensions of the road, lane-limits
and lead vehicle’s states are available to the subject vehicle

Each lane of the highway is assumed to have a nominal
desired velocity which is provided to the subject vehicle by
the route planner while the decision to perform an overtakingmanoeuvre and availability of the faster lane is veriﬁed by
the decision making block of the SV [51], [52]. The design
parameters, state, and input set constraints in Table I are usedto set up the scenario and controller within an integrated
Simulink and IPG CarMaker co-simulation platform. It is note-
worthy that, the constraints for the inputs were designed by
considering the steering and l ongitudinal acceleration applied
by an inbuilt IPG CarMaker controller for several smoothhigh-speed overtaking manoeuvres in CarMaker. Furthermore,
the control weights were chosen so as to ensure that the
generated trajectory was similar to the one obtained via IPGCarMaker’s default lane-change tr ajectory. Alternatively, other
techniques can be used to tune the control weights and a
comprehensive review of such techniques is available in [53]
and [54].
Remarks:
•As discussed in the section above, the optimal trajectorygenerated by the trajectory planner acts as referencesignal for a lower level trajectory tracking controller, see
Fig. 5. The trajectory tracking controller is responsible
for actuating the steering, accelerator/brakes to follow thereference trajectory as closely as possible while handling
system non-linearities and disturbances. In this paper,
the optimal velocity v
∗obtained from the robust MPC
is passed on to a longitudinal tracking controller as a
reference signal. The longitudinal tracking controller issensitive to the powertrain delays and factors them in
while computing an appropriate longitudinal acceleration
signal for the SV . On the other hand, the lateral trackingis performed by an adaptive controller that uses x
∗as
its reference to compute appropriate steering action [55].
In addition to tracking the reference trajectory as closely
as possible, these lower level controllers can handlesystem delays, tire nonlinearities, road surface variations,
etc. However, the task of longitudinal and lateral tracking
can also be performed by the multitude of techniquesavailable in literature but is beyond the scope of this paper
(the reader is referred to [29], [56]–[59] for possible
alternative techniques).

32-bit. The average time required at each time step for
the optimisation routine was 0.0077 s with a standarddeviation of 0.0011 s.
A. Robust Positive Invariant Set and MPC Implementation
The robust positive invariant set Zfor the error dynamics
and the nominal control law in (15), (16) is calculated using
the algorithm in [44]. The algorithm in [44] provides an iter-
ative technique based on the supporting function of polytopicsets to calculate the outer approximation of a minimal robust
positively invariant set for a discrete-time linear time-invariant
system. Equation (15) suggests that the structure of the set Z
has a dependence on ( i)s i z eo fs e t W,a n d( ii) the matrix A
K.
Since, the set Wis ﬁxed by the vehicle geometric constraints
and chosen longitudinal velocity range (see Table I), the only
degree of freedom available for designing the set Zis via the
design of a Hurwitz matrix AKby choosing an appropriate
controller Kto ensure stable error dynamics. The trade-off
for the design of the nominal controller with ﬁxed gain K
(or equivalently the design of the matrix) are twofold; ( i)t o
constraint the error set Zto a reasonable size such that
the deviation between nominal system and actual system isreduced and ( ii) to ensure that the input set ¯Ufor the MPC
is as large as possible, thus enlarging the decision space for
the MPC to compute smooth control inputs. Furthermore,it was noted that A
K-matrices with eigenvalues close to the
origin of the complex plane might result in an empty ¯U,
while if the eigenvalues of AKare close to the unit circle,
the set Zmight become so large that ¯Xis an empty set,
thus both extreme cases make the MPC problem in (18) ill-posed. For this application, this tradeoff was met by selecting
the dominant eigenvalue λofA
Kfor the lateral and yaw
dynamics such that Zis a bounded set and ¯Uis as large
as possible. Fig. 6 provides a visual representation for this
behaviour where the plot on the left depicts the disturbance
setWand the robust positively invariant set Zfor a given
controller, whereas the plot on the right depicts the net input
setUand the constrained input set ¯U. It is noteworthy that
only a projection of the disturbance and error sets onto the
lateral and yaw dimension of the system is plotted since the
disturbance for the system exists only along these dimensions,see (10). Furthermore, by increasing the dominant eigenvalue
beyond λ=0.72 results in a large Zthat renders ¯X=φ.
Likewise, the plots show that the error set grows along the

lateral position dimension as the eigenvalue changes whereas
the absolute limits along the heading angle dimension are close
to constant. However, even for the error set Zobtained with
the largest eigenvalue, the magnitude of the error limits inlateral position is a small fraction of the actual limits in lateral
position while allowing a large ¯Umaking it a suitable choice
for being used to solve the MPC problem in (18).
B. Simulation Results
A simulation environment is initialised with the subject
vehicle behind the lead vehicle and the initialisation para-
meters given in Table I. The simulation is then allowed
to run and the proposed framework performs three primary
tasks; ( i) surrounding risk zone detection, ( ii) safe target
identiﬁcation, and ( iii) trajectory generation at each sampling
time. Some details for each task output as well as overall
simulation results are discussed below. Fig. 7a and 7b shows
the snapshot of the output of the local risk map and target pointselection at the time instant t=14 s during the overtaking
when the subject vehicle has det ected the lead vehicle as it is
performing the ﬁrst lane change of the overtaking manoeuvre.Fig. 7a provides a 3D-view of the entire potential function
computed as in (29) and the local minima at the centre of
each lane for guiding a subject ve hicle can be seen along with
the trapezoidal ﬁeld created by a lead vehicle (it is noted that
in Fig. 7a and 7b large values of the potential ﬁeld are trun-cated for the sake of readability of the ﬁgure). Signiﬁcantly,
the potential ﬁeld approach can be expanded to accommodate
more lanes, additional trafﬁc members, and/or more complexroad geometries. Furthermore, the computation of potential
ﬁelds is based on simple mathematical operations and hence
addition of trafﬁc participants, more lanes, etc. will not result
in any signiﬁcant computation overhead. Similarly, the design
of collision avoidance constraints relies of basic mathemat-ical operations and thus collision avoidance constraints for
each trafﬁc participant can be generated without any major
computation overhead. However, the design of potential ﬁeldsfor different road types is not the primary focus of this body
of work and hence not discussed in greater detail. Fig. 7b
depicts the level curves of the potential ﬁeld for the same
time instant in the R-frame along with the reachable set of the
subject vehicle and identiﬁed target on the road computed asin (33), which also represents the output of the block Target
Id. In Fig. 7b, the lead vehicle is depicted as red rectangle
and the buffer zones (as triangular appendages), where thepotential ﬁeld rapidly increases to prevent the subject vehicle
from getting too close to the lead vehicle during the different
phases of an overtaking manoeuvre, can be easily observed.
As the region /Gamma1
lv(unsafe region) surrounding the lead vehicle
moves in the R-frame with speed vLV−v, at each time
step the local risk map of the safe reachable region and the
reference targets change acco rdingly. Fig. 8 shows some of
the target references selected by the subject vehicle for safelyovertaking.
The reference points, dynamically generated, are used by
the Trajectory Generation block in Fig. 5 the generation ofthe trajectory as described in Section VII. The results from

the entire simulation are depicted in Fig. 9. The trajectories
of the subject and lead vehicles as well as the relevant statesand inputs of the subject vehicle are shown in the inertial
frame in Fig. 9. Moreover, Gaussian noise is added to the
lead vehicle’s velocity in an attempt to ( i) introduce sensor
imperfections, ( ii) wireless network packet loss, and ( iii) lack
of accurate knowledge of lead-veh icle states. Introducing this
noisy signal in the potential ﬁeld calculation in (27) will
help in understanding if the proposed technique is robust
against the random variations in lead-vehicle states. The topplot shows the actual path followed by the subject and lead
vehicles and the trajectory of the overtaking manoeuvre for
the subject vehicle can be observed. Moreover, since theFig. 9. Simulation results: SV and LV tr ajectories, longitudinal velocity,

subject vehicle is travelling with a higher longitudinal velocity,
it covers a larger portion of the road segment in the given
time. The bottom four plots of Fig. 9 show the states andinput of the subject vehicle evolving over time. The key
aspect about the overtaking manoeuvre is that the overtaking
manoeuvre is initiated close to 10 s and one can observethe longitudinal velocity of the vehicle increasing while the
ﬁrst lane change manoeuvre is being performed. The reverse
behaviour (i.e., decreasing velocity while performing the lane
change) is visible after 20 s. This is reminiscent of a real-world
overtaking manoeuvre where a vehicle may accelerate ordecelerate while performing the lane change manoeuvre(s)
thus demonstrating the efﬁcacy of the proposed controller.
The noisy data from the lead vehicle’s velocity also doesnot have any impact on the trajectory planning process as
both the states and input signals are devoid of high-frequency
oscillation. Another key aspect is that the two states of SV ,
(i) longitudinal velocity and ( ii) heading-angle show smooth
evolution without any high-fre quency oscillation during either
of the lane-changes. The longit udinal acceleration proﬁle is
obtained via the tracking controller discussed above and it
also does not demonstrate any high-frequency oscillations.
However, it is designed using basic frequency-based tech-
niques and is not tuned to minimize the jerk but if required
this controller can be swapped with any preferred controltechnique available in literature. Similarly, the steering action
for the lateral motion demonstrates smooth evolution with
no high-frequency oscillation. Moreover, just as in the case
of the longitudinal tracking controller, if necessary another
controller for the steering action can be utilized with theproposed trajectory planning framework. Also, as expected the
MPC controller respects all the system and input constraints
which is evident from the plots in Fig. 9.

To show the need of the robust MPC to tackle variations of
the longitudinal vehicle speed while performing the overtaking
manoeuvre, we compare the performance of the proposedframework when the robust MPC in the Trajectory Generation
Block in Fig. 5 is replaced by the M PC strategy for disturbance
free LTI systems proposed in [30], referred in the rest ofthe paper as nominal MPC. The LTI vehicle model for the
design of the nominal MPC is obtained from system (13)
based on (9), while the remaining vehicle parameters forthe control tuning are set to those listed in Table I. It is
noted that, despite the fact th at nominal MPC is effective for
overtaking with ﬁxed speed (see [30] for further details), its
performance to generate feasible trajectories reduces when the
longitudinal speed change during the overtaking manoeuvre.This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 10 where the reference and actual
vehicle trajectories of the subject vehicle in the O-frame
of reference are depicted both for the nominal and robustMPC. These results demonstrate the nominal MPC struggles
to generate suitable trajectories for the overtaking manoeuvre
with varying longitudinal velocity. The trajectories suffer from
overshoot and also takes the subject vehicle very close to
the lead vehicle during the initial lane change. Both thesefactors make the nominal MPC based technique unsuitable for
planning overtaking trajectories with variable velocity. On the
other hand, the robust MPC based trajectory generates verylittle overshoot and also maintain the safety margins to the lead
vehicle during all three sub-manoeuvres. Furthermore, due to
its ability to generate consistent and uniform trajectories for
lane change while accelerating and decelerating, the controller
proposed in this paper appeals to a wider application set(lane-change, merging into tr afﬁc, etc.). It is noted that in
the proposed approach, the parameters of the MPC strategy
(i.e., Q,R,P,T,and N) can be tuned for adjusting the
aggressiveness of a manoeuvre. Additionally, at each time
step the optimisation problem underlying the robust MPC
techniques is always feasible according to Theorem 2 in [31].

ONCLUSION
In this paper, a modular control framework for autonomous
high-speed overtaking was presented with ( i) Local Risk Map
generation, ( ii) safe target identiﬁcation, and ( iii) trajectory
planning being the different modules of the system. In this
framework the onus of situational awareness lies with the
local risk map and safe zone identiﬁcation sub-systems andthe onus of feasible and collisi on-free trajectory generation
lies with the MPC controller. This modular design allows the
framework to avoid non-convex constraints allowing for anMPC formulation that can be solved using commonly available
optimisation solvers. Moreover, a robust tube based MPC tech-
nique with the nonlinearities in lateral and yaw dynamics due
to variation in longitudinal velocity being modelled as additivedisturbances has been used. Additionally, a novel technique
for designing collision avoidance constraints based only on
lateral position and longitudina l velocity of the subject vehicle
was presented. This allows the trajectory planning controller to
generate feasible and safe trajectories with admissible inputs
even while performing lateral manoeuvres with changing
longitudinal velocity. Numerical results in a Simulink/IPG
CarMaker co-simulation envir onment demonstrated that the
algorithm is able to fulﬁl the safety considerations for high
speed overtaking manoeuvre and generate trajectories which
are also compatible with the vehicle dynamics and safetyconsiderations. Furthermore, comparing the results of the
technique proposed to a normal MPC demonstrated the added
beneﬁts of the robust based approach. As future work the
proposed framework will be extended to ( i) more challenging
overtaking scenarios with multiple trafﬁc participants, externaldisturbances, etc. and ( ii) other manoeuvres under different
road geometries.
