Motion planning algorithms properties
Completeness:
If a solution exists, planner always finds a solution 
If no solution exists, terminates and reports failure 

Optimality:
Given a cost function for evaluating a sequence of actions, planner always returns a feasible sequence of actions with minimal cost. 
No solution

Types of motion planning algorithms
Combinatorial methods:
Consist in dividing the free space into small pieces and first solving the motion planning problem by connecting these atomic elements.  
They usually do not scale well for large environments.
Potential fields:
Each obstacle creates a sort of anti-gravity field which makes it harder for the vehicle to come close to it. 
They sometimes push the solution into local minima which can prevent the algorithm from finding a solution. 
Optimal control:
Finds an optimal trajectory using a dynamic model of the vehicle, the start configuration and the end configuration.
It gets complicated and computationally inefficient when the number of constraints due to other road users increases.



Motion Planning
Discrete methods:
Discretisation of configuration space and input space   
Deterministic graph search algorithms: A*, D*, D*-lite, etc.



Probabilistic methods:
Random exploration of the configuration and input spaces. 
Probabilistic graph search algorithms: RRT, RRT*, PRM, etc.

Sampling based methods
Motion Planning
A* algorithm:
One problem with regular (non-hybrid) A* is that the resulting discrete plan cannot be executed by a vehicle, simply because the world is continuous, whereas A* states are discrete 

When dealing with vehicles, we need a planning algorithm that can handle both discrete decisions and continuous actions. 

Hybrid A* algorithm:
The word “hybrid” here indicates a mix of both continuous and discrete elements.

Advantages of hybrid A* algorithm
Motion Planning
Hybrid A* combines the strengths of discrete search algorithms with the realities of continuous vehicle dynamics, making it suitable for real-world motion planning tasks.
While the classic A* algorithm gives us a foundation, Hybrid A* bridges the gap between idealised grid-world planning and the complexities of real-world vehicle movement.

Environment Classification 
UNSTERUCTURED:
     EX: Parking lot (maze)
Less specific rules and lower speed
No obvious reference path or trajectory
STERUCTURED:
     EX: Highway, Street driving
Predefined rules regarding how to move on the road
Direction of traffic
Lane boundaries
Speed limits
Road structure can be used as a reference

The need for time














Problems with s and d (and no t):
Doesn’t tell the full story
Need to incorporate t
3 Dimensions: s, d and  t (driving in traffic is a 3 dimensional problem)
You would have the same with x and y

Summary
None of the discussed methods is the best for every situation that a self-driving car will encounter. 

A car may use hybrid A* in parking lots, polynomial trajectory generation on low traffic highways, and maybe several others for situations like intersections, high traffic, etc.
