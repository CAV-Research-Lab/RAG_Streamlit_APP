Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of stabilizing the kinematic model of a car to a path in the plane
under rather general conditions. The path is subject to very mild restrictions, while the car model, although
rather simpliﬁed, contains the most relevant limitations inherent in wheeled robots kinematics. Namely,
the car can only move forward, its steering radius is lower bounded and a limited sensory information onlyprovides a partial knowledge of some state parameters. In particular, we consider the case that the current
distance and the heading angle error with respect to the closest point on the reference path can be measured
but only the sign of the path curvature is detected. These constraints are such to make classical controltechniques ineﬃcient. As the feedback information is both continuous and discrete, the hybrid systemsformalism turns out to be well appropriate to model the problem. The proposed approach is based on
optimal control techniques successfully applied in a previous work for following rectilinear path. We propose
here an extension to the tracking of more general paths with moderate curvature. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by means of the hybrid system formalism and hybrid formal veriﬁcation techniques.
Finally, the practicality of the proposed approach, in spite of non–idealities in real-world applications, is
discussed by reporting experimental results.
Keywords: nonholonomic vehicles, path–following, hybrid systems.
1 Introduction
In this paper we consider the design of a path–following controller for the so–called Dubins’ model of a car.
Dubins’ car is the kinematic model of a nonholonomic wheeled vehicle that moves only forwards in a plane, and
possesses a lower–bounded turning radius. The model is relevant to the kinematics of road vehicles as well as
aircraft cruising at constant altitude, or sea vessels.
The design of control techniques for nonholonomic veh icles has been the subject of extensive research works
for the past ﬁfteen years. Three diﬀerent problems are commonly considered: path–following, trajectory–
tracking and point–stabilization (see [9], [8] or [11] for surveys). Since the proof by Brockett [7] that nonholo-
nomic systems cannot be stabilized to a ﬁxed point by means of a pure state-feedback, the point-stabilization
problem has proven to be the most constrained one. To answer this problem, two kinds of alternative solutionshave been proposed which consist in designing either time-varying [19] or discontinuous feedback controls [2].
In particular, the application of optimal control techniques [18], [6], [24] has lead to the determination of the
synthesis of minimal-length trajectories for a car [23] (problems of Dubins and Reeds and Shepp) which provides
a canonical example of discontinuous stabilizing feedback.
Brockett’s limitation no more occurs when considering the dynamics of the robot’s conﬁguration error with
respect to a nominal path (i.e. a geometric curve) or a time-indexed trajectory. For this reason, many authors
have addressed the remaining two problems by considering classical techniques of automatic control such that,
tangent linearization [9], Lyapunov analysis [13], or sliding-mode [12]. However, though the model of a car witha bound on the steering wheel angle has been deeply studied for the point-stabilization problem, it has been less
considered when dealing with path–following or trajectory tracking. Such a steering constraint appears yet to
be crucial in making a kinematic model of a car relevant to real–world vehicles encountered in most applications.
1
Another important assumption which is commonly made in the path–following literature is that the full
state of the system is available for measurement, and that the path to be tracked is entirely known in advance.
Instead, we consider in this paper the more realistic and less demanding case that the robot can only measureits current distance and heading angle error with respect to the closest point on the reference path in the plane,
and that only the sign of the path curvature is detected.
The approach we follow here to make the Dubins’ car follow a general path is based on a previous work
involving optimal control techniques which has lead to th e characterization of minimum-length trajectories
to track rectilinear paths [22]. Due to both the nature of the problem, the type of sensors, and the solution
technique used, the analysis of the controlled system invol ves a rather complex switching logic. Hybrid formalism
(see [14, 26, 3]) and veriﬁcation techniques (see [17, 16, 1]) are extremely useful in this context to formally proof
stability of the resulting system.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a hybrid automaton that describes the motion of the vehicle
with respect to the path is introduced and the path–follo wing control problem is form alized. The model is based
on the use of a moving reference frame that gives the relat ive position of the vehicle with respect to the desired
path, with the interesting novelty that the moving reference frame switches its orientation according to the sign
of the curvature of the reference path. This simple trick greatly simplify the design and formal veriﬁcation of
the proposed controller. In Section 3, the path–following controller is developed. Such controller, described
in detail in Section 3.2, is obtained by considering a local approximation of the desired path with the tangent
line, and by using a feedback controller designed for stabilization on straight paths (reported in Section 3.1).The advantages of the novel hybrid path–following formalization are exploited in Section 4, where the stability
properties of the proposed controller are investigated. By a reachability analysis in the continuous state space,
a ﬁnite state abstract representation of the hybrid closed–loop automaton is derived. Then, using the ﬁnitestate abstraction, it is shown that the proposed hybrid feedback controller achieves stabilization of Dubins’ car
on a generic reference path and suﬃcient conditions for global attractivity are derived. Finally, experimental
results obtained by the proposed control law on a laboratory vehicle are presented in Section 5, along with a
discussion of practical issues in application of our algorithms.
2 Hybrid path–following modeling using switching Frenet’s frames
We consider the kinematic model of a car moving forwards in an horizontal plane, which was introduced byDubins in [10]. Considering a frame R(O,x,y ) attached to the plane of the robot’s motion, a conﬁguration of
the vehicle is deﬁned by an ordered pair ( M(x, y),θ)∈IR
2×S1,w h e r e( x, y) are the coordinates of a reference
point Mof the robot with respect to Randθis the angle made by the direction of the car with respect to the
x-axis of frame R. The kinematics of the car is described by

˙θ=ωwith |ω|≤V
R, (1)
where Vis the constant forward velocity, ωthe is turning velocity and the input constraint models a lower
bound R>0 on the turning radius of the Dubins’ car. The problem we are concerned with is that of steering
the vehicle to a given feasible path Γ, deﬁned by an arc–length parameterization as

for all x∈TΓthere exists a unique nearest point on Γ.
In order to describe the motion of the vehicle with re spect to the reference path Γ a mobile Frenet’s frame
is introduced. Given a vehicle position M(x, y)∈TΓ, the Frenet’s frame F(s) is deﬁned by the tangent, the
principal normal and the binormal axes of the curve at the point ( xγ(s),yγ(s)) of Γ which is at minimum
distance2fromM(x, y) (see Figure 1). As the vehicle moves with velocity V, the Frenet’s frame F(s) follows
its motion so as to keep it on the principal normal axis. The arc–length parameter slocates the current
position of the Frenet’s frame on the path Γ. The tangent and the principal normal axes of F(s)r e m a i nw i t h i n
the plane containing the curve, while the binormal axis points either upwards, if the local curvature of Γ iscounterclockwise (i.e. κ(s)>0), or downwards, if the local curvature is clockwise (i.e. κ(s)<0). Without loss
of generality, we assume that the Frenet’s frame does not switch orientation when entering a rectilinear segment
of the path Γ (for which κ(s)=0 ) .
Introduce the transformed coordinates ( s,˜y,˜θ), where:
•sis the arc–length parameter which deﬁnes the position of the Frenet’s frame along the curve;
•˜ydenotes the position of the car along the principal normal of F(s) (lateral distance) normalized with
respect to the minimum turning radius R;
•˜θdenotes its orientation with respect to the tangent axis of F(s) (heading angle error), with sign taken
according to the local direction of the binormal axis (see Figure 1).
The use of a mobile frame to state the path–following problem is rather usual in the literature (see e.g. [20]).
However, an interesting novelty of the proposed modeling is that the orientation of the moving reference frame
is switched according to the sign of the reference path cu rvature. This simple requirement allows us to simplify
the design and formal veriﬁcation of the proposed hybrid controller. Indeed, it allows to express canonically
two kinds of behavior depending on which side the robot approaches the path with respect to its convexity. Inthe (˜y,˜θ)–plane, the change of curvature along the path produces a jump of the representative point (˜ y,˜θ)t oi t s
symmetric with respect to the origin. This discontinuity allows us to express the change in the dynamics of the
error term (˜ y,˜θ) which results from the constraint on the vehicle’s turning radius and the local path curvature.
Roughly speaking, the vehicle can approach the path more easily if it lies on the opposite side of the osculating
circle with respect to the path
3. This formulation will turn out to be useful in the veriﬁcation of the proposed
path–following controller.
The motion of the car in the transformed state ( s,˜y,˜θ) can be described by using the formalism of hybrid
automata (see [14, 4]). The discrete nature of the model arises from the fact that the Frenet’s frame F(s) changes
its orientation during the motion, depending on the sign of the curvature κ(s). A discrete state, referred to as

3For instance, if the vehicle is required to approach a circle with curvature 1 /R, then it can approach it only from outside.

bin, models the two possible orientations of the binormal axis of F(s(t)) at time t, assuming either the value
up(when κ(s(t))>0o rκ(s(t)) = 0 after an arc with positive curvature) or the value down (when κ(s(t))<0
orκ(s(t)) = 0 after an arc with negative curvature). Its initial value is either up,i fκ(s(0))>0, or down,i f
κ(s(0))≤0. The complete hybrid automaton modeling the mo tion of the vehicle with respect to the reference
path Γ is reported in [5].
Notice that, for the so obtained hybrid model, the path–following problem reduces to that of stabilizing
the evolutions in the hybrid state space ( bin,(s,˜y,˜θ)) to the axis (˜ y,˜θ)=( 0 ,0). However, the evolutions of ˜ y
and˜θdepend on the path curvature κ(s), which forces the model to include the dynamics of the arc–length
parameter s. On the other hand, we should like to design a control law without resorting to the practically
unlikely assumption that the path curvature at a generic point on the path is known beforehand or can be
measured. We instead assume that only the sign of κ(s), and not its amplitude, is available to the controller.
To model such a case,
1. In the dynamics of ˜ yand˜θ, the absolute value of the local curvature |κ(s)|is replaced by an unknown
but bounded input disturbance d(t) with respect to which the path–following controller has to be robust.
By (3), the disturbance d(t)s a t i s ﬁ e s
0≤d(t)≤C<1. (5)
2. The switching conditions κ(s)>0a n d κ(s)<0, which trigger the transitions of the discrete state variable
binbetween the states down and up, are replaced by a discrete uncontrollable input σr, assuming either
the value switch (when a change of curvature sign occurs) or the silent move /epsilon1(otherwise).
With the two modiﬁcations above, the hybrid automaton HΓ, with reduced state space ( bin,(˜y,˜θ)), reported in
Figure 2 is obtained. The path–following problem for the model of the Dubin’s car (1) and a given a feasible
reference path Γ as in (2), satisfying conditions A),B)a n d C), can be reformulated as follows:
Problem 1 Given the hybrid automaton HΓ, ﬁnd a feedback control law ω(bin,(˜y,˜θ))satisfying the curvature
constraint (1) such that, from any initial state (bin0,(˜y0,˜θ0))the continuous trajectory (˜y(t),˜θ(t))converges to
the origin under the action of any unknown disturbance d(t), bounded as in (5), and any sequence of uncontrol-
lable events σr.
3 Hybrid path–following feedback controller
In this section, the proposed path–following controller is presented. The controller, described in details in
Section 3.2, is obtained by applying a feedback controller designed for stabilization on straight paths (reported
in Section 3.1) to the tangent line local approximation of the desired path.
3.1 Optimal feedback control for straight line following
In [22], the problem of driving a Dubins’ car to a straight path has been considered. An optimal feedback
control that minimizes the length traveled by the vehi cle to reach the speciﬁed path was devised. The method

and the direction of motion, when the r eference path is a straight line i.e. d= 0, is represented by directed

the input ωappears with opposite sign with respect to mode up. Since the controller modes in (8) has been
set assuming an upwards binormal axis then, the controller modes rightand lefthave to be switched when the
vehicle is in mode down. Hence, for a generic feasible path Γ, the state feedback controller is deﬁned in the
hybrid state space {up,down}×D(˜y,˜θ)by setting the controller modes as follows
•straight :i f( bin,(˜y,˜θ))∈{up,down}×Ω0;
•right :i f( bin,(˜y,˜θ))∈(up×Ω−)∨(bin,(˜y,˜θ))∈(down×Ω+);
•left :i f( bin,(˜y,˜θ))∈(up×Ω+)∨(bin,(˜y,˜θ))∈(down×Ω−);(13)
where Ω0,Ω−and Ω+are as in Table 1. The closed–loop hybrid automaton HF, obtained by applying the
feedback (7),(13) to the vehicle hybrid automaton HΓ, is depicted in Figure 4. Since the vehicle hybrid model
HΓhas two modes, namely {up,down}, and the controller has three modes, namely {straight ,right,left},t h e n
the hybrid closed–loop system could have at most six di screte states. However, by carefully analyzing the
continuous dynamics of the hybrid automaton HΓdepicted in Figures 2 and relations (8) and (13), it is easy to
conclude that the following combinations of controller modes and vehicle modes give rise to the same closed–loop
dynamics
•(straight ,up)a n d( straight ,down),
•(right,up)a n d( left,down),
•(left,up)a n d( right,down).
Hence, the closed–loop hybrid system HFhas a discrete state referred to as mode that assumes values in the
setO={zero,negative ,positive }, as follows
•mode =zero :i f( ˜y,˜θ)∈Ω0;
•mode =negative :i f( ˜y,˜θ)∈Ω−;
•mode =positive :i f( ˜y,˜θ)∈Ω+.(14)

the proposed path–following controller.
The initial state ( mode 0,(˜y0,˜θ0)) of the hybrid automaton HFhas to satisfy (14). Transitions between discrete
modes are due to either a change in the controller mode (triggered by (˜ y,˜θ)∈Ω−,0,+), or a switch of the Frenet’s
frame (modeled by σr=switch ). In the latter case, the continuous state jumps to the symmetric point with
respect to the origin (due to the reset ˜ y:=−˜y,˜θ:=−˜θ).
The coordinate transformation ( x, y, θ)→(s,˜y,˜θ) becomes singular when the vehicle lies on the center of the
local osculating circle to the path Γ. That is if, at some time ¯t,˜y(¯t)|κ(s(¯t))|=1 ,o re q u i v a l e n t l y˜ y(¯t)d(¯t)=1 .
For any initial conﬁguration ( M(x0,y0),θ0), with M(x0,y0)∈TΓas in (4), the corresponding state (˜ y0,˜θ0)
satisﬁes ˜ y0<C−1. Further, since by (5) d≤C,t h e n˜ y0d<1 for any feasible initial condition. However, to

holds along all the evolutions of HF, the set of admissible initial vehicle conﬁgurations has to be further
restricted. In order to guarantee (15) for all evolutions of HF, the restricted set of admissible initial vehicle
conﬁgurations has to be contained in the set {(˜y,˜θ)|˜y<C−1}and robust invariant under the action of the
disturbances σrandd. In particular, it has to be symmetric with respect to the origin of the continuous space
(˜y,˜θ), to satisfy invariance under resets ˜ y:=−˜y,˜θ:=−˜θdue to switching of the Frenet’s frame.

Initial conﬁgurations satisfying (17) correspond to initial vehicle positions M(x0,y0)∈TΓ,w i t h TΓas in (4).
More precisely, if the vehicle orienta tion is directed towards the closest p oint on the reference path (i.e. the
origin of the Frenet’s frame), with an angular displacement in a range of ±π
2with respect to the normal axis
to the path, then feasible conﬁgurations inside the set I(˜y,˜θ)in (17) correspond to lateral position errors lower

the coordinate transformation ( x, y, θ)→(s,˜y,˜θ), is never reached during the evolution of the vehicle under
the proposed control, provided that the reference path Γ has a minimum radius of curvature RΓgreater than

4 Analysis of the hybrid path–following controller
In this section, the behavior of the hybrid automaton HFis analyzed and convergence and stability results
for the proposed path–following controller are presented. The analysis is based on the introduction of an
equivalence relation ∼in the hybrid state space O×D(˜y,˜θ)and the computation of the corresponding quotient
system (see [14, 15]).
Consider the partition Π(˜y,˜θ)of the domain D(˜y,˜θ)in (6) given by the 24 subsets
/braceleftBig
r(1),···,rl(2)l(3),···,lsl(2),O/bracerightBig
,
deﬁned in the second column of Table 1, with O={(0,0)}andrl(2)l(3)=rl(2)∪l(3)replacing rl(2)andl(3).
The cells of the partition Π(˜y,˜θ)so deﬁned cover the region D(˜y,˜θ)and do not overlap.
Then, deﬁne in the hybrid state space O×D(˜y,˜θ)the corresponding 24 equivalence classes of type q∼
p=
(zero×p)∪(negative ×p)∪(positive ×p)w i t h p∈Π(˜y,˜θ).L e t∼denote the equivalence relation induced by
the partition of the hybrid state space O×D(˜y,˜θ)in subsets q∼

(mode 1,(˜y1,˜θ1)),(mode 2,(˜y2,˜θ2))∈D(˜y,˜θ)are equivalent, i.e. ( mode 1,(˜y1,˜θ1))∼(mode 2,(˜y2,˜θ2)), iﬀ (˜ y1,˜θ1)
and (˜y2,˜θ2) belong to the same subset p∈Π(˜y,˜θ).
By construction, the quotient space Q∼of the equivalence relation ∼is given by the set of equivalent
classes q∼
p. A reachability preserving quotient system is an automaton A=(V,V0,Σ,Ψ) with state4setVand
initialization set V0corresponding to the quotient space Q∼, event set Σ containing the event switch plus events
triggering feasible transitions between equivalent classes in Q∼, and transition function Ψ deﬁned as follows:

Let us consider ﬁrst the evolution of hybrid automaton HFsubject to the continuous disturbance donly.
Proposition 2 Given the hybrid automaton HF, if the discrete disturbance σralways takes the value /epsilon1,t h e n ,
for any initial hybrid state (mode,(˜y0,˜θ0))∈O× I(˜y,˜θ)as in (17), under the action of any disturbance dbounded
as in (5) with Cas in (16), we have:
•the quotient system obtained from the equivalence relation ∼is the automaton Adepicted in Figure 6;
•an upper bound for the space traveled by the origin of the Frenet’s frame along the path Γ, when the hybrid
state is in a given equivalence class is represented by the weight associated to the exiting arc;
•the quotient system Aremains in each equivalence class a bounded amount of time, except for the equivalent
class Owhere (˜y,˜θ)=( 0 ,0).
The proof of the above proposition, which is based on reachability analysis, is reported in the appendix.
If the reference path Γ has curvature always of the same sign, the convergence of Dubins’ car to the path is
guaranteed by:
Corollary 1 If the reference path Γhas curvature always of the same sign and minimum radius of curvature

along the reference path Γbefore the vehicle reaches it with correct orientation.
The proof of the above corollary is obtained by computing the longest path to the node Oon the graph of the
automaton Adepicted in Figure 6.
By Proposition 2, if Γ is a straight line then the closed–loop system enforces sliding motions in the space
(˜y,˜θ) on the lines sr,sland the arcs r(1),l(1),r(3),l(3)until the origin is reached (see [25] for a tutorial on
sliding mode control). If the reference path Γ is not a straight line, sliding motions are enforced only on the
lines sr,sl,o nt h ea r c s r(1),r(3)and on a piece of the arc l(3). Under ideal sliding motion, in a neighborhood of
the origin the control ωswitches at inﬁnite frequency between the values −V
R,0a n dV
R. The mean value of such
control (i.e. the so called equivalent control ) is exactly the signal κ(t)Vthat makes the car follow the reference
path Γ with velocity V. In the real implementation, smoothing techniques are applied to avoid the chattering
of the control signal between the three values −V
R,0a n dV
R.
Let us now analyze the behavior of the closed–loop system HFunder the action of both the discrete distur-
bance σr(representing changes of the curvature sign of the reference path) and the continuous disturbance d
(representing the local curvature amplitude).

(19)
is a robust invariant set for the hybrid closed–loop system HFsubject to any disturbance d(t)bounded as in (5)
and any sequence of events σr.
The proof of the above proposition is reported in the appendix.
The robust invariant set N(˜y,˜θ)given in (19) is depicted in Figure 5. Notice that, robust invariance of N(˜y,˜θ)
is demonstrated for any disturbance dupper bounded by C<1, that is, for any reference path Γ with minimum
radius of curvature RΓstrictly greater than the minimum turning radius Rof the vehicle. In fact, the more
conservative constrai nt on the reference path RΓ>(√
2+1 ) Rintroduced in Corollary 1 to ensure avoidance of
singular points can be relaxed to RΓ>Rwhen the system is inside the robust invariant set N(˜y,˜θ).
The set N(˜y,˜θ)deﬁned in (19) is such that
N(˜y,˜θ)⊂O∪r(1)∪l(1)∪lr(1.1)∪lr(1.2)∪rl(1.1)∪rl(1.2).
Since, by Proposition 3, N(˜y,˜θ)is a robust invariant, then, if we restrict our attention to the domain N(˜y,˜θ),
the transitions from lr(1.2)tolsr(2)and from rl(1.1)torsl(1)in the quotient system Ashould be removed.
Furthermore, under the action of the discrete disturbance σr=switch ,t h er e s e t˜ y:=−˜y,˜θ:=−˜θintroduces
the mutual transitions r(1)←→l(1),lr(1.1)←→rl(1.1),a n d lr(1.2)←→rl(1.2). Hence, in presence of the discrete
disturbance σrand for any disturbance das in (5), when the initial state of the closed–loop hybrid system
HFbelongs to O×N(˜y,˜θ), a reachability preserving quotient system abstracting the behavior of HFis the
automaton ANdepicted in Figure 7.
Suﬃcient conditions for stability of the origin and convergence inside the robust invariant set N(˜y,˜θ)are
given by the following:
Proposition 4 If the reference path Γis such that changes in the curvature sign are at distance greater than
(5+π
2)Ralong it, then origin Ois a robust stable equilibrium point for the hybrid closed–loop system HFsubject
to continuous disturbance d(t)bounded as in (5) and the discrete disturbance σr.
Proposition 4 ensures that the hybrid feedback control ( 7), with modes chosen accord ing to (13), stabilizes the
Dubins’ car along any reference path Γ satisfying conditions A,BandC, provided that the reference path does
not change curvature too fast. Robust global convergence to the reference path Γ are guaranteed under the
hypothesis of Corollary 1, if the refer ence path does not change the curvature sign before vehicle has reached
the reference path or, more conserv atively, the Frenet’s frame has c overed a distance given by (18).

5 Experimental Results
Experiments were devised to assess practicality of the proposed methods against discrepancies of our models
from real-world implementation, such as non–negligible dynamics, disturbances in state measurements, and low
sampling and communication time. The system used for e xperiments is the same of t hat described in [22], and
consists of a mobile robot (model LabMate of Transition Research Corporation) equipped with a laser-based
position sensor (a SIMAN laser scanner, with internal pre-processing unit), a PC mounted on-board, and a
ﬁxed PC communicating via a radio-modem link (4800 bps). Code concerning low-level treatment of lasermeasurement is implemented on the processor embedded i n the sensor, while the low-level feedback control
laws are run by the on-board CPU. The code resident on the ﬁxed PC implements the high level planning and
GUI. The latter consists of such functions as describin g the reference path, setting parameters for the sensor
and controller, and collecting and processing experimental data for analysis and visualization. Information on
the vehicle position and orientation is obtained by a Kalman ﬁlter processing odometric information (encodermeasurement of wheel rotations) along with angular measurements given by the ladar.
In the ﬁrst experiment, reported in Figure 8, the reference path is a circle of radius R
Γ= 110 cm that
has to be tracked clockwise. The vehicle minimum turning radius is set to 60 cm and the forward velocity isﬁxed to 3 .6 cm/sec. Correspondingly, according to (3), the upper bound on the normalized curvature κ(s)i s
R
RΓ≡C=0.5455. Starting from an initial position external to the circle, the vehicle approaches the reference
path by a trajectory composed of two circular arcs of opposite maximum curvature, performed with angular
velocity ω=±0.060 rad/sec. Hence, after a transient of 30 seconds, the vehicle keeps on the path by rapidly
switching among the rightand leftmodes, proceeding with angular velocity of mean value −3.6/110 = −0.0327
rad/sec. Notice that, to reduce the problem of fast switching of the control signal between the values ±0.060
rad/sec (known in the sliding mode literature as “chattering”, see [25]), we applied a smoothing technique
(see e.g. [21]), which eﬀectively introduce thin “boundary layers” about lines of control discontinuity in statespace. More precisely, the sign function on the boundary curves of type σ(˜y,˜θ) = 0 between regions with
ω=+V/Randω=−V/Rwas approximated by
σ
/epsilon1+|σ|,w i t h /epsilon1=1 0−3. Although a thorough treatment of the
new system arising from modifying the proposed controller by introducing a further region in the state space for
modeling the boundary layer is potentially complex, and not studied yet, it is to be expected from experiencein sliding control that a degree smoothing in the switching control law would not alter the general behavior
and performance. Results of this experiment show that model non–idealities do not inﬂuence much the overall
satisfactory behavior of the system.
The desired path for the second and t he third experiment is composed of a circular arc of radius 60 cm, a
segment of length 50 cm, and a circular arc of radius 75 cm (see Figure 9 and Figure 10). Both experimentsare performed with a minimum turning radius of 40 cm and a forward velocity of 6 .64 cm/sec. Since the upper
bound on the normalized curvature κ(s)i sn o w C=0.667 and the vehicle forward velocity is greater, then the
control problem is more challenging than the previous one.
In the second experiment, depicted in Figure 9, the sign al of the laser-based position sensor is directly used

to obtain on–line the position and orientation error. As shown in Figure 9, the signal from the sensor is quite
noisy. The inaccurate information of the sensor in conjunction with the eﬀects of unmodeled phenomena and
algorithm implementation produces so me interesting behaviors. Indeed, vehicle and actuator dynamics are such
that the actual angular velocity of the vehicle does not take the values requested by the proposed feedback
controller. Even more important is the eﬀect of implementing the proposed control scheme, requiring very high
control activity, on a platform with limited loop bandwidth, such as due in this case to computational and
communication limitations. These eﬀects combined with t he inaccurate vehicle position information are such
that the system misses hooking up to the sliding surface at ﬁrst transversal.
Finally, in the third experiment shown in Figure 10, an extended Kalman ﬁlter is introduced to ﬁlter the
signal produced by the laser-based position sensor. As represented in Figure 10, the noise on the position and
orientation error is in this way signiﬁcantly reduced. The more accurate feedback signal greatly improves the
closed–loop performance. The system reach es the origin of the reduced state space (˜ y,˜θ) by evolving in sliding
motion without missing sliding surface.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have used modern techniques developed for hybrid systems modeling and veriﬁcation to solveand prove stability of a closed–loop control strategy a diﬃcult problem, that is route following by nonholonomicvehicles with bounds on the curvature and limited sensory information. The proposed controller is reminiscent
of a synthesis proposed elsewhere for an optimal control problem to track straight routes, whose generalization
13
to generic routes turned out to be diﬃcult to analyze otherwise. We believe that this case study, besides its
intrinsic interest in applications, also has a value in show ing the potential of hybrid systems analysis techniques
as applied to complex control problems.

P r o o fo fP r o p o s i t i o n1 . We have to show that the set I(˜y,˜θ)in (17) is a robust invariant set, under any
action of the continuous disturbance d, bounded by Cas in (16), and any action of the discrete disturbance
σr=switch . To prove this we will ﬁrst show that, along the trajectories of the closed–loop hybrid system
HF,˙σ1>0 in a right neighborhood of the curve σ1(˜y,˜θ) = 0, and ˙ σ2<0 in a left neighborhood of the curve
σ2(˜y,˜θ) = 0. The upper bound (16) for Cguarantees that there exists a right neighborhood of the curve
σ1(˜y,˜θ) = 0 contained in the region rsr∪sr∪lsr, and there exists a left neighborhood of the curve σ2(˜y,˜θ)=0
contained in the region rsl∪sl∪lsl. This simpliﬁes the analysis of the closed–loop system trajectories.
By (14) and (7), the closed–loop continuous dynamics are

From (21–22) and the above upper and lower bounds on˙˜θwe can conclude that in a right neighborhood of
the curve σ1(˜y,˜θ) = 0, contained in rsr∪sr∪lsr,w eh a v e˙ σ1>0, and in a left neighborhood of the curve
σ2(˜y,˜θ) = 0, contained in rsl∪sl∪lsl,w eh a v e˙ σ2<0. Finally, since under the action of the discrete disturbance
σr=switch the continuous state is reset to the symmetric point with respect to the origin, at which corresponds
a same value of functions σi(˜y,˜θ), invariance the set I(˜y,˜θ)is preserved under any switchings of the Frenet’s
frame. Q.E.D.
Remark. In [5], an easier proof for Proposition 1 for the case C<1
3instead of (16) is presented.
P r o o fo fP r o p o s i t i o n2 . In this proof we ﬁrst show that the ﬁnite state machine Adepicted in Figure 6
is the quotient system obtained from the equivalence relation ∼applied to the closed–loop hybrid system HF,
when there is no action of the disturbance σr, provided that Cis bounded as in (16). Then, we provide upper
bounds for the length of the arcs spanned by the origin of the Frenet’s frame on the reference path Γ, in each
state of Aduring the motion of the closed–loop system.

The motion of the origin of the Frenet’s frame is described by the curvilinear abscissa s(t), whose dynamics

of the Frenet’s frame, while the system evolves in region S, can be obtained by solving, for all possible initial
conditions (˜ y1,˜θ1)∈S, an optimal control problem that gives the worst disturbance d⋆for which

is maximized, subject to the dynamics (20), and up to a time τsuch that (˜ y(τ),˜θ(τ)) belongs to the boundary
ofS.
By solving this optimal control problem we obtain that
•singular solutions correspond to trajectories belonging to either srorsl,f o rw h i c h L(sr)=L(sl)=0s i n c e
the robot tracks a line perpendicular to the reference path Γ.
•for no–singular trajectories, d⋆is constant.
Furthermore, since inside any region Sof Π, ˜θ(t) is monotonic, then the maximum length traveled by the origin
of the Frenet’s frame can be obtained integrating with respect to ˜θinstead of time. By (20), we have

Proof of Proposition 3. By applying a reachability analysis, we show that the hybrid system HFunder the
action of the continuous disturbance d(t) and the discrete disturbance σrkeeps the trajectories originating in
N(˜y,˜θ)inside N(˜y,˜θ).
First of all, notice that N(˜y,˜θ)is symmetric with respect to the origin. Therefore, states in N(˜y,˜θ)remain
inside N(˜y,˜θ)after any state reset ˜ y:=−˜yand˜θ:=−˜θdue to an event σr=switch .
Consider a partition of the set N(˜y,˜θ)\Ointo the regions r(1)\{(−1,π
2)},l(1)\{(1,−π
2)},lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ),
rl(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ),rl(1)∩N(˜y,˜θ),a n d lr(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ). By analyzing the trajectories due to the action of the disturbances
d(t)a n d σrin each element of this partition, we show that the y exit a region only to enter another one of them,
eventually reaching the origin O. This demonstrates the invariance of the set N(˜y,˜θ).
Region r(1)\{(−1,π
2)}. According to Proposition 2, the state (˜ y,˜θ) is steered to the origin Owith
/bardbl(˜y(t),˜θ(t))/bardblmonotonicly decreasing. Under the action of an event σr=switch , the state jumps instantaneously
to the symmetric point in l(1)\{(1,−π
2)}.
Region l(1)\{(1,−π
2)}. According to Proposition 2, either the state (˜ y,˜θ) is steered to the origin if d(t)=∞
(with /bardbl(˜y(t),˜θ(t))/bardblmonotonicly d ecreasing) or enters region lr(1.2)ifd(t)<∞at some ˜θ>−π
2. Under the
action of an event σr=switch , the state jumps instantaneously to the symmetric point in r(1)\{(−1,π
2)}.
Region lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ). The hybrid system HFis in mode mode =positive .B y( 1 ) ,˜ y<0 and therefore,
by (5), we have 0 <1
d(t)−˜y<1. From (20),˙˜θ>0a n d ˙˜y>0. Then, any state (˜ y,˜θ)∈lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ)is steered
tor(1)\{(−1,π
2)}.I fa ne v e n t σr=switch occurs, the state jumps instantaneously to the symmetric point in
region rl(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ).
Region rl(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ). The hybrid system HFis in mode mode =negative . By (20),˙˜θ<0a n d ˙˜y<0.
Then, any state (˜ y,˜θ)∈lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ)is steered to l(1)\{(1,−π
2)}.I f a n e v e n t σr=switch occurs the state
jumps instantaneously to the symmetric point in region lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ).
Region rl(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ). The hybrid system HFis in mode mode =negative . Consider the function
σup
N(˜y,˜θ)=−1−˜y+2c o s ( ˜θ) and observe that, within region rl(1.2),σup
N(˜y,˜θ)>0⇔(˜y,˜θ)∈N(˜y,˜θ). By (20)

R>0 for all states within this region, except for ˜θ= 0. Therefore, any trajectory
originating in rl(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ)cannot escape the region through the upper boundary σup
N= 0, and will either
reach the sliding surface r(1)\{(−1,π
2)}(for some ˜θ>0), pass to rl(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ)through the boundary ˜θ=0 ,
or jump symmetrically to lr(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ)under the action of an event σr=switch .
Region lr(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ). The hybrid system HFis in mode mode =positive . Consider the function
σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)=−1+˜y+2c o s ( ˜θ). Within this region, we have σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)<1a n d σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)>0⇔(˜y,˜θ)∈N(˜y,˜θ).
Further, by (20), ˙ σdw

R. Therefore, for any ˜θ/negationslash=0 , ˙σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)>0⇔0<σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)<
d(t)−1. Since σdw
N(˜y,˜θ) always increases except for σdw
N(˜y,˜θ)>d(t)−1, being by (5) d(t)−1 nonnegative,
(˜y,˜θ) never crosses the boundary σdw
N(˜y,˜θ) = 0. Then, trajectories originating in lr(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ)cannot leave
this region through the boundary σdw
N= 0. Instead, they may leave region lr(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ)either through the
boundary with lr(1.1)∩N(˜y,˜θ),˜θ=0 ,w i t h˜ y>−1, or by jumping symmetrically to region rl(1.2)∩N(˜y,˜θ)for an
event σr=switch . Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4. To analyze the convergence of the trajectories to O, introduce the function
W(˜y,˜θ)=1
2(˜y2+˜θ2). (31)
W(˜y,˜θ) has the property that, if at time t=¯t,σr=switch ,t h e n W(˜y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)) = W(˜y(¯t−),˜θ(¯t−)). The

exists das in (5) such that µ(˜y,˜θ)>0a n d ˙W> 0. Otherwise, if (˜ y,˜θ) is such that η1(˜y,˜θ)<0, then there

Consider an initial condition (˜ y0,˜θ0) in a neighborhood of the origin contained in N(˜y,˜θ)∩rl(1.2). At the initial
time, the hybrid model HFis in mode negative . Let us assume that σr=/epsilon1, for the moment, and let us analyze
the evolution of the hybrid model HF(see Figure 12). Under the action of the worst disturbance (33), the
trajectory (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) originating from (˜ y0,˜θ0) reaches the curves r(1).F i r s t W(t) decreases (in rl(1.2)), then
it increases (in rl(1.1)). Hence, mode switches to positive .W(t) decreases (in the ﬁrst part of lr(1.2)), and it
increases again later on (in lr(1.2)andlr(1.1))u n t i l( ˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) reaches r(1). Finally, following a sliding motion
along the curve r(1),( ˜y(t),˜θ(t)) reaches the origin.
Along this trajectory W(t) assumes two local maxima, which correspond to the intersections of l(1)and
r(1), and two local minima: the ﬁrst on the line ˜θ=0w h e n˜ y>0, and the second inside region rl(1.2).L e t
24
δ=/bardbl(˜y0,˜θ0)/bardbl. Since the trajectory (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) is continuous with respect to the initial condition (˜ y0,˜θ0), then
there exist two continuous functions ζmax,ζmin:I R→IR s u c h t h a t
max
dmax
t/bardbl(˜y(t),˜θ(t))/bardbl=ζmax(δ),min
dmin
t/bardbl(˜y(t),˜θ(t))/bardbl=ζmin(δ). (34)
Further, since the local maximum and minimum points tend to the origin as /bardbl(˜y0,˜θ0)/bardbltends to zero, then
limδ→0ζmax(δ) = 0 and lim δ→0ζmin(δ)=0 .
Suppose now that a discrete disturbance σr=switch occurs at the precise time ¯tat which (˜ y(¯t−),˜θ(¯t−))
is opposite to (˜ y0,˜θ0) with respect to the origin. Then, the state (˜ y(¯t−),˜θ(¯t−)) is reset to (˜ y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)) =
(−˜y(¯t−),−˜θ(¯t−))∈N(˜y,˜θ), which lies on the same line to the origin of (˜ y0,˜θ0). IfW(˜y0,˜θ0)>W(˜y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)) =
W(−˜y(¯t−),−˜θ(¯t−)) then the convergence is preserved. But, if W(˜y0,˜θ0)<W(˜y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)) =W(−˜y(¯t−),−˜θ(¯t−))
then, under the action of the discrete disturbance σr=switch ,t h es t a t e( ˜ y,˜θ) is reset to a point farther away
from the origin than the initial state (˜ y0,˜θ0) and convergence can be lost.
However, if the reference path Γ is such that changes in the curvature sign are at a distance greater than
(5 +π
2)Ralong it, between to successive actions of the discrete disturbance σr,t h es t a t e( ˜ y,˜θ) has enough time
to reach the origin. In fact, assuming that, in the worst case, (˜ y(¯t),˜θ(¯t))∈N(˜y,˜θ)∩rl(1.2), an upper bound on
the length the arc of Γ spanned by the origin of the Frenet’s frame as (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) converges to the origin, is
given by L(rl(1.2))+L(rl(1.1))+L(l(1))+L(lr(1.2))+L(lr(1.1))+L(r(1)) that, according to t he weights reported
on the quotient system Adepicted in Figure 6, evaluates to (5 +π
2)R.
To prove the robust stabilization of the car along the reference path Γ we have to show that for any /epsilon1>0,
there exists δ>0 such that any trajectory (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) of the hybrid system HF, originating from any (˜ y0,˜θ0)
with/bardbl(˜y0,˜θ0)/bardbl<δ,w eh a v e /bardbl(˜y(t),˜θ(t))/bardbl</epsilon1.
Given any /epsilon1>0, consider any initial condition (˜ y0,˜θ0)w i t h
/bardbl(˜y0,˜θ0)/bardbl≤δ=ζ−1
max(ζ−1
min(ζ−1
max(/epsilon1))). (35)
The trajectory (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) evolves inside a ball of radius ζ−1
min(ζ−1
max(/epsilon1)). If a disturbance σr=switch occurs
at some time ¯t, then the state is reset to (˜ y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)) = (−˜y(¯t−),−˜θ(¯t−))∈N(˜y,˜θ). In the evolution for t>¯t
the trajectory reaches the origi n before a further discrete distu rbance occurs. Moreover, since /bardbl(˜y(¯t),˜θ(¯t)/bardbl≤
ζ−1
min(ζ−1
max(/epsilon1)) then, the trajectory (˜ y(t),˜θ(t)) for t>¯tdoes not exit a ball of radius ζmax(ζ−1
max(/epsilon1)) =/epsilon1. Then, the
hybrid feedback control (7), with mod es chosen according to (13) robustly stabilizes the car along the reference
path Γ. Q.E.D.
