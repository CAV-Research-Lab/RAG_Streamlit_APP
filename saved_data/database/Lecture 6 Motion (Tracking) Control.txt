Introduction




Motion control, also known as tracking control, refers to the fact that a control system should be able to track the desired reference trajectory produced by the motion planning module.

Introduction
Model-free controllers:
do not use any mathematical model of the vehicle
tend to take “corrective” action based on the “error” between setpoint and current state. 
are quite easy to implement 
are difficult to tune 
do not guarantee optimal performance
perform satisfactorily under limited operating conditions. 


Motion (trajectory tacking) control methods:
Model-based controllers:
use mathematical models of the vehicle
provide optimal actions
are easy to tune 
are easy to implement 
are sensitive to parameter variations 
are sensitive to model accuracy.

Introduction
Kinematic controllers:
use simplified motion models of the system 
are based on the geometry and kinematics of the system
offer an advantage of low computational complexity  
are restricted to low-speed applications 

Dynamic controllers:
use detailed motion models of the vehicle and are based on system dynamics 
consider forces and torques acting on the system as well as any disturbances 
suffer computational complexity

PID control
An optimiser algorithm (such as twiddle, gradient descent, etc.) can then be adopted to fine-tune the gains through recursive updates.

Kinematic model
Kinematics is the study of motion of a system disregarding the forces and torques that govern it. 
Kinematic models can be employed in situations wherein kinematic relations are able to sufficiently approximate the actual system dynamics 
The vehicle bicycle model performs well at capturing the actual vehicle dynamics under nominal driving conditions.
