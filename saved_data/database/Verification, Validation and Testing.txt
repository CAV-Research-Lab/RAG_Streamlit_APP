Industry Standards and Regulatory Requirements 
ISO 26262: Functional Safety for Road Vehicles
SOTIF (Safety of the Intended Functionality)
ASIL, or Automotive Safety Integrity Levels 
Verification, Validation and Testing
Saber Fallah (ENGM298)
11
Industry Standards and Regulatory Requirements 
UNECE WP.29 for Automated and Connected Vehicles

Cybersecurity
Software updates
Emergency braking systems 
Individual countries often have additional local regulations too. 
Beyond technical standards, ethical and liability concerns are also a big part of the regulatory conversation.

Scenario-based Testing for Autonomous Vehicles
What is Scenario-based Testing?
Testing under a broad range of pre-defined scenarios to cover edge cases

Advantages:
Reduces unknown risks
Forces the system to act in extreme and rare situations (edge-cases)
