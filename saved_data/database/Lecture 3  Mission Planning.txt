Introduction to Search Algorithms in Mission Planning
Search algorithms are systematic methods used to explore and analyse data. 
They help the system navigate through a vast array of possibilities to find the most optimal solution. 
In the context of mission planning, they help the intelligent vehicle find the best route from Point A to Point B.
They analyse data from various sources, such as maps, traffic data, and sensor data, to identify the best route for the vehicle to follow.

Types of Search Algorithms
Uninformed search algorithms systematically explore all possibilities until they find a solution. 




Informed search algorithms have access to extra information or 'heuristics' about the problem, which helps guide the search process towards a solution.

Key Differences Between Search Algorithms
Uninformed search algorithms are like explorers navigating uncharted territories, while informed search algorithms are like guided tourists, leveraging knowledge of the area to find their way efficiently.

Uninformed search algorithms are useful when there is little to no additional information about the problem while informed search algorithms shine when there is extra information that can guide the search process. 

In the context of mission planning for autonomous vehicles, informed search algorithms might leverage data such as real-time traffic information, weather conditions, and road quality to optimise the route planning.

Problem-Solving Intelligent Vehicle 
In the context of intelligent vehicles:

	States: can be defined as a specific condition or circumstance in which the vehicle finds itself at a particular moment. 

	Actions: refer to the operations or manoeuvres that an autonomous vehicle can undertake to transition from one state to another.

Actions and states
Understanding the concept of states and actions is fundamental to comprehending the decision-making process of intelligent vehicles

???
A simplified road map of part of Romania, with road distances in miles. 
Problem-Solving Intelligent Vehicle 
An intelligent vehicle needs to have several pieces of information:

The initial state is the starting point, or where the vehicle currently is. 
The state space is the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions.
The possible actions are the various manoeuvres the vehicle can make to transition from one state to another.
The goal test is a method that allows the vehicle to ascertain whether a state is a goal state. For instance, in our example, reaching Bucharest would satisfy the goal test.
The path cost function is a function that assigns a cost to a path. In all cases we will consider, the cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the individual actions along the path. 
The solution is the output of a search algorithm that is, a path from the initial state to a state that satisfies the goal test

Choosing states and actions
Our initial state is 'in Arad,' and the goal test asks: 'Are we in Bucharest?’

The operators, or actions available, correspond to the various routes between cities. 

To determine the optimal solution, we need a path cost function.

How do we decide what to include in our state and operator descriptions?

Best-first search
Search Algorithms
A node as a data structure encompassing five components:

The corresponding state in the state space.
The parent node in the search tree that generated this node.
The operator applied to generate this node.
The node's depth, which is the number of nodes from the root to this node.
The path cost from the initial state to this node.

Data structure for search trees
Performance of Search Algorithms
We assess these strategies using four key criteria: 

Completeness: Does the strategy always find a solution when one exists?
Time Complexity: How much time is required to find a solution?
Space Complexity: What is the memory requirement to execute the search?
Optimality: Does the strategy find the highest-quality solution when multiple solutions exist?"

Summary
The concept of a search algorithm, which involves exploring a state space to identify a sequence of actions leading from an initial state to a goal state. 
The importance of nodes and states in the search process, elaborating that nodes are the bookkeeping data structures for the search tree, while states represent world configurations. 
The performance measurement of search algorithms

Breadth-first search
Uninformed Search Algorithms
When actions have different costs, an obvious choice is to use uniform-cost search where the evaluation function is the cost of the path from the root to the current node.

Pruning
Pruning: means eliminating possibilities from consideration without having to examine them. 

A* search is complete, cost-optimal and optimally efficient among all such algorithms is rather satisfying.
